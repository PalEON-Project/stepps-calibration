\begin{abstract}
  Quantifying historical states of forest ecosystems is necessary to
  understand the processes governing forest dynamics in a changing
  world. Fossil pollen data provide information about past forest
  composition, but rigorous interpretation requires development of
  pollen-vegetation models (PVMs) that account for interspecific
  differences in pollen production and dispersal and other
  factors. Widespread and intensified land-use over the 19th and 20th
  centuries may have altered the pollen-vegetation relationship. Here
  we use STEPPS, a Bayesian hierarchical spatial PVM, to estimate key
  process parameters and associated uncertainties in the
  pollen-vegetation relationship.  We experiment with alternate
  dispersal kernels, and calibrate STEPPS using a newly developed
  settlement-era calibration data set that relies on Public Land
  Survey data and fossil pollen samples matched to the settlement-era
  through expert elicitation. All variations of the Power-law kernel
  model outperformed all variations of the Gaussian model, indicating
  that pollen dispersal kernels are fat tailed.  Pine and birch have
  the highest pollen productivities. Roughly 1 - 45\% of pollen produced by
  trees in each 8 km grid cell remain in that grid cell, with 55-99\%
  deposited elsewhere.  The 90\% capture radius ranged from 380 km for
  hemlock to 608 km for other hardwood for the best-fit model.  Pollen
  productivity and dispersal estimates are generally consistent with
  previous understanding, although source area estimates are
  larger. Tests of model predictions demonstrate the ability of STEPPS
  to predict regional compositional patterns.

\section{Introduction}
Understanding past forest compositional change provides valuable
information about ecosystem response to biotic and abiotic factors at
timescales outside the realm of most direct ecological observations,
particularly with respect to dynamics of tree species, and vegetation
feedbacks to other components of the earth system. Fossil pollen
records extracted from sediments of lakes and mires are our primary
source of data about prehistoric forest composition. Rigorous
estimates of past forest composition from these records rely on our
ability to quantify the relationship between the composition of fossil
pollen assemblages and the composition of the vegetation that produced
them.

% \citep{jackson2007looking}, particularly with respect to information

% and mires are our primary source of data about prehistoric forest
% composition. Rigorous estimates of past forest composition from these
% records rely on our ability to quantify the relationship between the
% composition of fossil pollen assemblages and the composition of the
% vegetation that produced them.

The pollen-vegetation relationship is governed by the processes of
pollen production, transport, and deposition and has been the subject
of palynological study for decades \citep{tauber1965,
  jacobson1981selection, jackson1994pollen, jackson1999pollen,
  sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2, prentice1988records}. The
pollen found in lakes and mires usually arrives by wind, coming from
plants that vary in their pollen productivity and dispersal. Some
plant taxa are highly overrepresented in sedimentary archives while
others are underrepresented or absent. A variety of pollen-vegetation
models (PVMs) have been developed including linear-regression
\citep{webb1981estimating, bradshaw1985relationships}, extended
R-values \citep{parsons1981statistical, sugita1994pollen,
  sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2}, modern-analog based
approaches \citep{overpeck1985quantitative, williams2003variations},
and, most recently, Bayesian hierarchical models
\citep{paciorek2009mapping, garreta2010method}.  In these models,
pollen dispersal can be assumed constant \citep{davis1963theory,
  parsons1981statistical}, modeled to decline away from the source as
a simple inverse square or other function \citep{webb1981estimating,
  calcote1995pollen, jackson1998quantitative}, or parameterized using
various pollen-transport models, usually based on the Sutton models of
particulate dispersal \citep{prentice1988records, sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2, jackson1999pollen}. Here, as in
\citet{paciorek2009mapping}, a Bayesian hierarchical spatial approach
is used to model pollen counts from a network of ponds as a function
of gridded forest composition data, taking into account pollen
dispersal (from both local and regional vegetation), differential
pollen production, and process uncertainty. Pollen dispersal
descreases with increasing distance from the source, XXX

% without
%requiring prior knowledge about taxon-specific differents with respect
%to pollen production and dispersal processes.

% The spatial scale at which we can infer past forest composition
% varies, and depends in part on the grain and extent of the forest
% composition data used to calibrate the PVM. Some PVMs deal with highly
% spatially resolved pollen dispersal events (REFS), while others are
% more coarse in nature (REFS). Model structure is motivated by the
% scientific question at hand - a model built to help understand the
% physics of pollen transport requires different tools than one whose
% goal is to estimate the functional response between vegetation and
% deposited pollen across locations. In this work, our spatial scale is
% large in both grain and extent relative to most other PVMs, which
% reflects our motivation to estimate forest composition at a regional
% scale. As such, we do not aim (and will not be able) to resolve
% depositional events or composition heterogeneity at scales smaller
% than that determined by our grid cell size. However, we can infer
% composition at a coarser scale, over a large extent, which informs us
% about broad compositional shifts across space and time.

PVMs are calibrated using pollen and forest data. Some PVMs, notably
the LOVE/REVEALS family of models \citep{sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2}, require information about pollen dispersal
properties for individual taxa, which are then used to parameterize
diffusion-based models of particulate transport [e.g.,
\citet{prentice1985pollen}]. Other PVMs are calibrated against spatial
networks of pollen assemblages extracted from surface sediment
samples, which are then cross-referenced to contemporary spatial
datasets of vegetation composition and abundance of the surrounding
forests \citep{sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2}. These
cross-referenced pollen and vegetation datasets are then used to build
empirical models that can be used to infer past forest composition
from fossil pollen assemblages. Most spatially calibrated PVMs are
often not explicitly process-based, but sometimes the parameters in
these empirical models given insight into process (e.g. the
y-intercept in linear regression models provides an estimate of pollen
deriving from non-local sources \citep{howe1983calibrating}).
Bayesian hierarchical models, however, are flexible and can be
designed to include parameters that specifically represent processes
in pollen production, transport, and deposition
\citep{paciorek2009mapping}.

Most PVMs are used to reconstruct vegetation in the relevant pollen
source area of a deposition basin. Previous studies have shown that
the size of the deposition basin may affect the relevant pollen source
area, with sediment pollen from larger lakes providing better
representation of the regional pollen signal \citep{sugita2007theory1,
  sugita1994pollen, jacobson1981selection}. In the LOVE/REVEALS models
\citep{sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2}, background pollen is
estimated based on pollen counts from large lakes, and is then used to
inform local vegetation estimates from pollen counts at smaller
depositional sites. Estimates of pollen productivity, fall speeds, and
atmospheric conditions are required model inputs. Some of these
required inputs are difficult to determine; they may be difficult to
measure or quantify, or variable through time and/or space
\citep{jackson1999pollen}. Here, we avoid the need for these inputs
using a coherent hierarchical framework that allows us to estimate
these process parameters and their uncertainty. However, the main
advantage of the Bayesian PVM presented here is its ability to allow
the model to borrow information across space and time, taking
advantage of our understanding of the nature of compositional
change. Currently we assume that the size of the depositional basin
does not affect the distance weighting of the surrounding
vegetation. This is in part a result our restricted ability to resolve
smaller-scale compositional gradients near depositional basins because
of the spatial resolution of the vegetation data used here. Although
the lack of higher-resolution vegetation-sampling imposes some error
\citep{bradshaw1985relationships, prentice1987quantitative,
  jackson1990}, all sites regardless of size receive much of their
pollen from regional sources and hence are sensitive to broader-scale
vegetation patterns and gradients \citep{bradshaw1985relationships,
  prentice1987quantitative, jackson1991pollen, sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2}.


%% The main advantage of this approach is the ability to borrow
%% information across space to estimate governing parameters and their
%% uncertainty at a regional scale, without the reliance on prior
%% quantification of ecological or physical processes.


%% Bayesian hierarchical models,
%% however, are flexible and can be designed to include parameters that
%% represent processes in pollen production, transport, and deposition
%% \citep{paciorek2009mapping}.


For all PVMs, extending them to make inference about palynological
processes and vegetation composition for times other than the time of
calibration requires the assumption that the pollen-vegetation
relationship is constant. This assumption of constancy seems
reasonable at first approximation; although tree taxa may vary in
their productivity and dispersal both in space and time, the relative
differences among taxa should be less variable
\citep{parsons1981statistical}.  However, given the magnitude of both
compositional and structural modification of vegetation by human
land-use in the past two centuries in eastern North America and
elsewhere, this assumption merits serious investigation and testing
\citep{kujawa2015}. Recent human land-use has altered forest
composition and structure in at least five ways.  First, ecotonal
gradients within forests of the upper Midwest were steeper in
presettlement forests than they are now
\citep{goring_witness}. Second, most forests of the region are now
secondary, and so differ in density, biomass, size-structure, and
age-structure from pre-settlement forests
\citep{rhemtulla2009legacies}.  Third, land clearance, forest
management practices, and successional processes have led to
fundamental changes in forest composition, such that early
successional trees such as poplar and maple are more abundant now than
in the 19th century \citep{thompson2013four}.  Fourth, the overall
pattern of forest mosaics in the region may be different - in some
cases more spatially homogeneous (e.g., forest management practices)
but in others more heterogeneous (e.g., locally idiosyncratic
disturbance or land-use legacies) \citep{thompson2013four,
  wang2007spatial}. Finally, fire suppression during the 20th century
may have led to increasing forest density and changes in abundance of
fire-adapted species \citep{nowacki2008demise}.

These changes in forest composition, structure, and landscape pattern
may have directly influenced pollen production and dispersal
\citep{kujawa2015}.  Pollen production, for example, may be greater
for trees growing in the open or at forest edges
\citep{feldman1999cost}.  Pollen dispersal is affected by properties
of both the forest canopy and the land surface
\citep{jackson1999pollen}.  A more serious issue for pollen-vegetation
relationships may be that at the landscape level, many contemporary
forests have no historical analogues \citep{goring_witness}. Shifting
forest composition can alter pollen-vegetation relationships because
of the Fagerlind effect, in which relative pollen representation of
one taxon is affected by that of all other taxa contributing to an
assemblage \citep{prentice1988records}. It is possible to account and
correct for the Fagerlind effect \citep{prentice1986,
  jackson1995exploration}, but empirical corrections are contingent on
particular vegetational contexts \citep{jackson1998quantitative}.

Most PVMs are calibrated using contemporary forest data; few studies
have examined presettlement pollen-vegetation relationships
\citep{schwartz1989predicting}.  However, recent work from Minnesota
has shown that pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions calibrated
with pre-settlement pollen data differ significantly from those using
modern pollen data \citep{st2014bias}. The compilation of settlement
era Public Land Survey (PLS) forest composition records from the
western Great Lakes region \citep{goring_witness, bourdo1956review,
  schulte2001original, almendinger1996minnesota}, along with a new
dataset of settlement era fossil pollen records from the upper
midwestern US \citep{kujawa2015}, largely drawn from the Neotoma
Paleoecological Database (www.neotomadb.org), provides an opportunity
to calibrate a PVM for the early to mid-19th Century, thus avoiding
the effects of settlement, agriculture, and industrialization.

Cross-referencing settlement-era forest composition with appropriate
fossil data requires identification of pollen samples that are
contemporaneous with the pre-settlement era.  In eastern North
America, land-clearances during EuroAmerican settlement led to
increases in certain agricultural and weedy plant taxa; these
increases can be used as direct biostratigraphic markers of the
settlement horizon in pollen records. Of these, the rise in ragweed
(\textit{Ambrosia}) abundance is generally the most prominent
\citep{mcandrews1988human}, and is widely used by palynologists to
identify the EuroAmerican settlement horizon. Identifying the
settlement horizon in this way requires interpretation of pollen
seqeuences; the uncertainty associated with this interpretation has
not been assessed to date. Here we use expert opinion from four
paleoecologists to reduce bias and quantify uncertainty associated
with the identification of biostratigraphic signals. Results from this
exercise are used to construct a settlement-era pollen calibration
data set.

Using the settlement era PLS forest composition and pollen datasets,
we calibrate a Bayesian hierarchical PVM based on the STEPPS
(Spatio-Temporal Empirical Prediction from Pollen in Sediments) model
\citep{paciorek2009mapping}. We then use these results to predict
settlement-era vegetation composition for the upper midwestern domain,
and assess our ability to predict vegetation composition by comparing
spatial predictions with the settlement-era forest composition
data. As part of this work, we test and compare two standard isometric
dispersal kernels. We apply the PVM results to develop new estimates
of relative pollen productivity and source area, assess the relative
importance of local and non-local pollen sources, and compare these
results to prior estimates of source area and pollen productivity.

\section{Data and Methods}

\subsection{Data}

\subsubsection{Spatial domain}

The study area is the upper midwestern US, including Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan.  This region includes two major ecotones: the
``Tension Zone'' between northern mixed forests and temperature
broadleaved deciduous forests (\citet{curtis1959vegetation}), and the
prairie/forest/savanna ecotone.  Both of these ecotones have been
heavily modified by contemporary land use \citep{goring_witness}. We
focus on the upper midwestern US because 1) there is interest in
understanding past compositional changes, especially with respect to
the ecotone, and 2) there is sufficient forest and pollen data to make
and assess quantitative predictions.

\subsubsection{Public Land Survey (PLS) data}
Prior to major European settlement, the US General Land Office
conducted a Public Land Survey (PLS) throughout much of the United
States to simplify the sale of federal lands. The PLS mapped the
United States west and south of Ohio on a 1$\times$1 mi grid for the
sale of public lands \citep{stewart1935public, white1983history}. At
section corners surveyors placed a stake as the official location
marker, and then recorded the closest two to four trees, measuring the
distance from tree to point center, tree diameter and the (often
idiosyncratic) common name of these trees
\citep{mladenoff2002narrowing}.

This data set provides a systematic survey of the forest before
settlement, and has been used by foresters, ecologists, and historians
to learn about ecosystem and land-use change through time. In the
upper midwestern US, the survey was conducted during 1834-1907
\citep{stewart1935public}.

Recently these point-level data have been standardized and aggregated
across the upper Midwest to a 64 km$^2$ grid (8$\times$8 km) on an
equal-area Albers projection (proj4:
+\textit{init}=\textit{epsg}:3175) to account for changing survey
instructions through time (cf. Stewart, 1935) and to provide
sufficient spatial resolution for regional scale analysis
\citep{goring_witness}.  This aggregation results in an average count
of 134 trees per grid cell. This tree count per cell is low, but
because of the uniform spatial sampling the ecological patterns and
regional structure of the dominant forest taxa are evident
\citep{goring_witness}. In a given grid cell, the raw data provide
noisy estimates of composition proportions because of the limited
number of trees per cell. Instead, we used composition estimates
provided by \citet{paciorek2015}, who used a statistical model that
borrows information across nearby grid cells to estimate the
composition proportions in each grid cell with uncertainty. Here we
work with these PLS composition estimates. Although they are not data
in the true sense, for our purposes they are assumed to be fixed;
hereafter these PLS composition estimates are referred to as PLS data.

\subsubsection{Tree taxa}

For the upper midwestern US domain, \citet{goring_witness} report
fifteen tree taxa directly, however the full dataset contains 28 taxa.
Most taxa are resolved to the level of genera, and the list of taxa
includes ``No Tree'' (21 \% of points) when surveyors did not find a
tree within a reasonable distance, ``Unknown Tree'' (0.001 \% of
points) when the common name used to identify the tree could not be
resolved, and ``Other Hardwood'' (0.02 \% of points) when the surveyed
tree was clearly a hardwood, but could not be resolved beyond that
level. We focus on a subset representing two functional groups
(Deciduous and Coniferous taxa) and 10 tree genera that include the
most abundant taxa as well as less-abundant taxa of particular
ecological importance. Our modelled taxa are: ash, beech, birch, elm,
hemlock, maple, oak, pine, spruce, and tamarack (see
Table~\ref{table:pollen_acc} for the scientific name
translations). The remaining tree taxa, including ``Unknown Tree'',
are aggregated to ``Other Hardwood'' or ``Other Conifer'', which
amount to 10 \% and 7 \% of the included trees respectively.``No
Tree`` is excluded from further analysis.

% \textit{Abies}, \textit{Acer}, \textit{Betula},
% \textit{Fagus}, \textit{Fraxinus}, \textit{Larix}, \textit{Picea},
% \textit{Pinus}, \textit{Quercus}, \textit{Tsuga}, \textit{Ulmus}

% The separation of other
% hardwood and conifers allows the calibration model to treat ecological
% group separately, teasing out inherent differences between conifer and
% deciduous pollen production, although variability in production and
% dispersal within each group is large.

\subsubsection{Pollen data}

Advances in paleoecoinformatics \citep{brewer2012paleoecoinformatics,
  grimm2013encyclopedia} have made it possible to easily access and
query large datasets using tools such as the multi-proxy
Pliocene-Quaternary database Neotoma (\url{neotomadb.org}). The
development of the Neotoma API has provided a foundation for the
development of a map-based search interface - the Neotoma Explorer
(http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/) - and the neotoma package for R
\citep{goring2015}. Using these tools we identified 176 sedimentary
pollen records in the Neotoma database from the upper midwestern
US. To be considered useful for our purposes each record was required
to include multiple pollen samples within the last 2000 years.  An
additional 57 cores, not available from Neotoma at the time of this
project, were contributed by independent researchers
\citep{kujawa2015}. These additional records include 9 pollen count
time series records and 48 records that consist only of the core top
and pre-settlement assemblages, hereafter referred to as before-after
records. This new settlement-era pollen dataset is fully described in
\citet{kujawa2015}.

These pollen records are obtained from the classification of pollen
grains based on morphological features into groups that correspond
with plant taxa, which is a labour intensive and skill-dependent
process. Each pollen count represents a sample from a larger
population with associated uncertainty \citep{maher2012assessment,
  maher1981statistics}, although uncertainty from pollen
identification and counting is negligible for regional-to-global-scale
syntheses focused on the most common taxa from lake and mire sediments
\citep{webb1978sensing, webb1978mapped}. These data are collected by
independent researchers and as such require the standardization of
pollen taxonomies to account for differing nomenclature and taxonomic
resolution. Pollen taxonomies were standardized using the STEPPS
translation table from \url{neotoma}, which is reported as
supplemental material.

\subsubsection{Identifying the EuroAmerican settlement horizon in pollen records via expert elicitation}

Widespread land clearance during European settlement provided habitat
for many ruderal plants, resulting in increases in non-arboreal taxa
which are evident in pollen count time series
\citep{mcandrews1988human}. In the upper midwestern US, significant
increases in ragweed (\textit{Ambrosia}), docks and sorrels
(\textit{Rumex}), and grasses (\textit{Poaceae}) typically mark this
settlement horizon. 

Here we use expert elicitation to identify the representative
settlement horizon sample, defined as the sample that falls
immediately before the increase in agricultural indicator species, at
each of the 185 sites with pollen count time series data. All expert
elicitation relies on judgment. The degree of uncertainty resulting
from this expert judgment varies widely among sites as a result of the
temporal density of pollen samples, time-averaging of sediments, the
rapidity of forest clearance and landscape transformation, and the
pollen representation of dominant trees, which can dampen or amplify
the ragweed signal. At some sites, the settlement horizon is
unambiguous, while at others the transition is less clear (see
Figure~\ref{fig:elicit}).

For this study, in the interest of reducing bias and quantifying
uncertainty, we: 1) use consistent methodology to identify the
settlement horizon for the pollen sites, and 2) assess the variability
in assignment of the settlement horizon among analysts. Four expert
palynologists (Goring, Jackson, St. Jacques, Williams) participated in
the elicitation exercise. Each expert was provided with pollen
diagrams depicting proportional changes through time as a function of
depth for key indicator plus the ten most abundant arboreal taxa for
the last 2000 years as determined by the default neotoma age-depth
models. Experts were prohibited from relying on stratigraphic dates
(radiocarbon or other) or age-depth model estimates of sample age. If
experts could not distinguish the settlement horizon, they were
instructed to report NA. If experts were uncertain about their
settlement horizon determination, they were instructed to note this,
with or without justification. Expert identifications were checked
against age assignments based on age-depth models obtained from the
Neotoma Paleoecology Database or that we constructed using the
original age controls and the bacon age model
\citep{blaauw2011flexible}.  Results from this exercise were used to
define depths associated with settlement horizon samples and their
uncertainty. Pollen samples corresponding to the selected settlement
horizon depths were included in our calibration data set.

% To calibrate a PVM against PLS forest composition data, prior to major
% anthropogenic disturbance, requires pollen data that is
% contemporaneous with the pre-settlement era. Pollen assemblages from
% past times are obtained by coring depositional environments including
% lakes, mires, and forest hollows, among other locations, in which the
% cell walls of deposited pollen are preserved. Contemporaneous pollen
% assemblages are identified largely using the estimated age of the
% pollen sample, obtained from chronologies constructed using classical
% \citep{blaauw2010methods} or Bayesian \citep{blaauw2011flexible,
%   buck1999bcal, blaauw2005radiocarbon, ramsey1995radiocarbon}
% methods. Chronologies are developed using dated stratigraphic control
% points from within a core, which may be geochronological (dated
% material), geostratigraphic (e.g., the ``modern'' core top), and
% sometimes biostratigraphic (changes in pollen assemblages associated
% with dated changes on the landscape). Geochronological control points
% are dated using radiometric dating (typically radiocarbon
% (${}^{14}C$), but sometimes lead-210 ($^{210}$Pb) or cesium-137
% ($^{137}$Cs)), although these dates are uncertain due to analytical
% errors during the laboratory radiometric dating process
% \citep{ward1978procedures}, the conversion of radiocarbon to calendar
% years \citep{reimer2013intcal13}, and potential differences between
% age of macrofossil material and age of sediment
% \citep{blois2011methodological}. Geostratigrahic markers may have
% fewer sources of uncertainty - the core top age is assumed to be the
% year of sampling, although sedimentary mixing of the upper sediment
% during sampling does introduce some uncertainty. Finally,
% biostratigraphic control points are determined by examination (usually
% visual) of changes in pollen assemblages throughout a core, and are
% typically only used when there a well established understanding of a
% large-scale event that led to consistent changes in the pollen
% records.

% The pollen sample that best represents pre-settlement times can be
% identified using the pollen sample age, as estimated by an age-depth
% chronology. However, age-depth modelling of sediment requires
% assumptions about depositional processes that can be difficult to
% quantify, resulting in potentially uncertain age-depth
% predictions. Instead, we rely on a panel of experts to identify a
% biostratigraphic change in pollen records associated with European
% settlement, thus reducing bias associated with biostratigraphic marker
% identification, and eliminating the need to assign a date to a
% representative pollen sample.

% Widespread land clearance during European settlement provided habitat
% for many ruderal plants, resulting in increases in non-arboreal taxa
% in pollen time series \citep{mcandrews1988human}. In the Upper
% Midwest, significant increases in ragweed (\textit{Ambrosia}), docks
% and sorrels (\textit{Rumex}), and grasses (\textit{Poaceae}) typically
% mark this settlement horizon. Here we use expert elicitation to
% identify the representative pre-settlement sample - the sample that
% falls immediately before these increases in agricultural indicator
% species. All expert elicitation relies on judgement. The uncertainty
% in pre-settlement sample identification varies widely among sites as a
% result of the chronological density of pollen samples
% \citep{liu2012temporal}, time-averaging of sediments, the rapidity of
% forest clearance and landscape transformation, and the pollen
% representation of dominant trees, which can dampen or amplify the
% \textit{Ambrosia} signal. At some sites, the settlement horizon is

\subsection{Models}

In this section we describe the Bayesian hierarchical PVM. In our
workflow, vegetation reconstruction using the PVM is composed of two
phases: calibration and prediction. In section~\ref{sec:cal}, we
describe the calibration model used to estimate the parameters that
describe the processes that link vegetation composition to sediment
pollen through pollen production and dispersal. Then, in
section~\ref{sec:pred}, we describe the prediction model used to
estimate settlement-era vegetation composition. In
section~\ref{sec:imp} we describe computational software and tools
used to estimate parameters.

\subsubsection{Calibration model overview}
\label{sec:cal}

Here we describe the calibration model used in the first phase of the
vegetation reconstruction. For the sake of clarity, we first provide
an overview of the model, and then introduce the mathematical
notation.

The pollen counts that we observe are a function of the vegetation on
the landscape, i.e. the composition and abundance of trees on the
landscape determines (in part) the composition and abundance of pollen
that is deposited in the sediment. Determining how much pollen the
surrounding vegetation contributes is a complex function of forest
characteristics (e.g., composition, structure, patchiness, spatial
stationarity), climate (including wind), grain size and morphology,
topography, and proximity of the vegetation to a deposition basin.

We work on an 8 km grid defined by the resolution of the gridded PLS
data and define each deposition site as having both local and
non-local pollen contributions. Local contributions are made by the
vegetation within the same grid cell as a site, and non-local
contributions are made by vegetation from all other grid cells in the
domain. The relative contribution of local versus non-local pollen is
determined by a model parameter, with the restriction that the sum of
all contributions from the pollen source area must be one.

Contributions from non-local grid cells are not all equal; their
relative contributions are distance-weighted according to a dispersal
kernel, which determines how likely it is for pollen to travel from
one grid cell to another. The dispersal kernels used here are
isometric so they depend only on the distance of the tree to the
deposition site, and not on the absolute position or direction. In
reality, dispersal may not be isometric, owing to prevailing wind
directions during pollen-dispersal seasons, regional topography,
surface roughness, and vegetation patchiness on the
landscape. However, isometric dispersal kernels are a reasonable and
widely used approximation \citep{sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2}, because turbulent atmospheric mixing below the
boundary layer tends to smooth out anisotropies.

Here, we choose two kernels that are representative of the short- and
long-tail kernel classes, the Gaussian and the inverse Power-law
kernels, and compare between these generalized functional forms. The
Gaussian kernel is often used as a reference against more leptokurtic
kernels such as the inverse Power-law kernel, and can represent
dispersal through diffusion. While the Gaussian kernel has simpler
mathematical representation, fatter-tailed kernels (such as the
inverse Power-law) in general perform better than those with thinner
tails (like the Gaussian or Exponential) when modelling pollen
dispersal \citep{devaux2007modelling, austerlitz2004using}. However,
pollen dispersal data needed to validate pollen dispersal models are
generally unavailable, especially at the large spatial scales required
to adequately test long-tailed kernels \citep{clobert2012dispersal}.

%  Both the gaussian and inverse power law kernels have
% been successfully applied to pollen data ??.  

To determine how much pollen a grid cell contributes to a deposition
site such as a pond, the vegetation composition proportion vector is
scaled by a taxon-specific parameter ($\phi$) that accounts for
differential pollen production among plant species. The local
contribution is determined by the scaled vegetation vector for the
grid cell that contains the pond. For all grids cells in the domain
that do not contain the pond, the scaled vegetation vector is
multiplied by the weight assigned by the dispersal kernel (which
depends on the distance to the pond and the kernel parameters). The
total non-local contribution is the sum of the scaled and weighted
vegetation vectors over all grid cells that do not contain the
pond. The relative importance of the local and non-local contributions
is determined by the local strength parameter $\gamma$, and the sum of
the scaled local and non-local contributions determines the predicted
sediment pollen at the pond.

\subsubsection{Calibration model}

Here we give a more detailed description of the calibration model. As
described, the spatial domain is regular grid is composed of 64 km$^2$
discrete cells, but the underlying vegetation composition and
dispersal spatial processes are continuous functions of space. Spatial
cells are indexed by $s=1,\ldots,S$, where $S=8013$. Hence, all grid
cells in the domain are potential sources of pollen.

Pollen produced by vegetation within each grid cell can be deposited
within that grid cell or dispersed into the neighborhood around that
grid cell. For grid cell $s_i$, the pollen produced by taxon $p$
within that cell that remains local is given by
\begin{align}
\gamma \phi_p r_p(s_i)
\end{align} 
where $\gamma$ is the proportion of pollen produced in $s_i$ that is
deposited in $s_i$, $\phi_p$ is the scaling factor that accounts for
differential production, and $r_p(s_i)$ is the proportional abundance
of vegetation of taxon $p$ in $s_i$.

The remaining ($1-\gamma$) proportion of pollen produced in $s_i$ is
dispersed to other grid cells according to an isometric dispersal
kernel centered at $s_i$. The dispersal kernel weights all pollen
dispersing away from the focal cell as a function of the distance from
$s_i$ to any neighboring cell $s_k$ by $w(s_i, s_k)$.

The two dispersal kernels considered here are: (i) the Gaussian and
(ii) the inverse Power-law. The Gaussian kernel is defined as 
\begin{align}
  w_g(s_i, s_k) = \exp\left( - \frac{d(s_i, s_k)^2}{\psi^2} \right),
\end{align}
where $d(s_i,s_k)$ defines the distance between cells $s_i$ and $s_k$
and $\psi>0$ is a parameter that describes the spread of the
kernel. The inverse Power-law kernel is defined as
\begin{align}
w_{pl}(s_i, s_k) = \frac{(b-2)(b-1)}{2 \pi a^2} \left( 1 + \frac{d(s_i, s_k)}{a} \right)^{-b},
\end{align}
where $a>0$ and $b>2$ are parameters that determine the kernel
shape. As expected, the weight assigned by both kernels is a
decreasing function of distance - less pollen is distributed farther
away.

%Previous work has shown that pollen dispersal distances can reach up to XXXX, and that long-distance dispersal events may be rare, but have the ability to drive range expansion XXX.
 
Pollen produced by taxon $p$ dispersing from $s_i$ to $s_k$ is then
described as
\begin{align}
(1-\gamma) \phi_p r_p(s_i) w(s_i, s_k).
\end{align}

% We can then define the pollen produced by taxon $p$ dispersing from
% $s_i$ to $s_k$ by
% \begin{align}
% \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p r_p(s_i) w(s_i, s_k),
% \end{align}
% where $C$ is a normalizing constant equal to the sum of the weights of
% all the cells to which pollen can be dispersed, defined be a
% rectangular region that covers and extends beyond the limits of the domain.

%% An anisotropic kernel may better approximate true pollen dispersal due to prevailing winds, although prevailing wind direction in the Upper Midwest is not constant throughout the domain due to the proximity to the great lakes, making the inclusion of this asymmetry complicated. %

%and therefore including this non-constant asymmetry in the modeling framework is not straightforward. 

So far we have characterized the model from a source-based
perspective, describing how pollen disperses from the grid cell in
which it was produced. We would like to quantify the pollen arriving
at pond $i$ located in the grid cell $s_i$ - our data are counts of
pollen grains that have been dispersed to the depositional site and
deposited in the sediment. This arriving pollen is equal to the sum of
the locally deposited pollen plus the pollen dispersed to $s_i$ from
other grid cells in the domain that are within the maximum dispersal
distance of $s_i$. Therefore the pollen from taxon $p$ arriving at
pond $i$, referred to as $r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}}$, is given by
\begin{align}
r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}} = \gamma \phi_p r_p\bigl(s_i\bigr) + \frac{1}{\Omega} (1-\gamma) \phi_p \sum_{s_k \neq s_i } r_p(s_k) w\bigl(s_i, s_k\bigr)
\label{eq:arriving}
\end{align}
where $\Omega$ is a normalizing constant equal to the sum of the
weights of all the cells to which pollen can be dispersed, defined to
be a circle of radius 700 km. Note that $\Omega$ depends on the
dispersal kernel, and therefore varies as a function of dispersal
kernel parameters. However, for a given a set of parameter estimates,
$\Omega$ is constant across the domain.

Finally, we need to relate the arriving pollen $r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}}$
quantified in Equation~\ref{eq:arriving} to the pollen count data. To
do this, we must consider that the pollen data are overdispersed - the
counts are more variable than we might expect if they were assumed to
follow a multinomial distribution. This overdispersion is at least in
part (and perhaps mostly) attributed to heterogeneity in the pollen
production and dispersal processes that are not accounted for in our
mathematical characterization, but is also an artifact of the
comparison of pollen counts at a point location (the depositional
site) situated anywhere within a focal grid cell to a grid-based
vegetation composition average. As such, the pollen counts at
depositional site $i$, denoted by $\bm{y}_i$, are modelled by a
Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) distribution, a compound distribution used
to account for overdispersion in multinomial count data (and tends to
the multinomial distribution in the case of no overdispersion). We
have that
\begin{align}
\bm{y}_i \sim DM (n_i, \bm{r}_i^{\text{pol}})
\label{eq:DM}
\end{align}
where $\bm{r}_i^{\text{pol}} = (r_{i,1}^{\text{pol}}, \ldots,
r_{i,K}^{\text{pol}})$.  The precision $\alpha_i$ is equal to the sum
of Equation~\ref{eq:arriving} over all taxa
\begin{align}
\alpha_i = \sum_{p=1}^K \Bigl[\gamma \phi_p r_p\bigl(s_i\bigr) + \frac{1}{\Omega} (1-\gamma) \phi_p \sum_{s_k \neq s_i } r_p(s_k) w\bigl(s_i, s_k\bigr)\Bigr].
\label{eq:alpha}
\end{align}
Note that the precision parameter $\alpha_i$ is affected by the
proximity of a depositional site to the domain boundary. We do not
have PLS data outside of the defined upper midwestern US domain, so
cannot quantify the pollen dispersed from vegetation outside the
domain arriving at depositional sites in our domain. The repercussion
of this is that the sum of the weights of the grid cells contributing
pollen to a depositional site close to the domain boundary is less
than the sum of the weights of the total potential contributing
neighborhood, defined as $\Omega$. The result of having a smaller
contributing neighborhood is that the local pollen contribution is
effectively up-weighted relative to the non-local contribution (see
Equation~\ref{eq:alpha} ).

\subsubsection{Model priors}

Uninformative priors are assigned to the model parameters. For all
calibration models, we set the priors $\phi_k \sim \text{uniform}(0,
300)$ for $k=1, \ldots, K$ and $\gamma \sim \text{uniform}(0,1)$. For
dispersal kernel parameters, we note that we work with megametre (Mm)
distance units, where $1 \text{Mm} = 1000 \text{km}$. For the Gaussian
kernel we define the prior $\psi \sim \text{uniform}(0, 2)$, while for
the Power-law kernel we have $a \sim \text{uniform}(0, 500)$ and $b
\sim \text{uniform}(2, 6)$.

\subsubsection{Model variants}
\label{variants}

As currently described, neither dispersal kernel ($w_{pl}$ or $w_g$)
nor the parameter $\gamma$ vary by taxon. In this base model, a single
dispersal kernel defines all pollen dispersal and a single parameter
determines what proportion of pollen remains local. In reality pollen
dispersal varies among species; pollen-grain morphology, size, weight,
and release mechanism all vary systematically among plant taxa
\citep{jackson1999pollen}. Here, we let the data inform us if there is
sufficient evidence to support taxon-specific dispersal parameters
through the use of exchangeable priors \citep{gelman2014bayesian}. An
exchangeable prior defines the same prior distribution on each of the
$K$ parameters in question as a function of shared
hyperparameters. When the variance hyperparameter is estimated to be
small, we can conclude that there is not sufficient evidence in the
data at hand to support taxon-specific parameters.

In the Gaussian kernel case we evaluate the support for taxon specific
values of $\psi$ using the exchangeable prior
\begin{align}
\log(\psi_k) \sim \text{normal}( \mu_{\psi}, \sigma_{\psi})
\end{align}
for taxon $k=1, \ldots, K$ where $\mu_{\psi} \sim
\text{uniform}(\log(0.1),\log(2))$ (the log of the $\psi$ prior
interval in the single-taxon case), and $\sigma_{\psi} \sim
\text{halfCauchy}(0, 2)$, a half-Cauchy with mean of 0 and standard
deviation 2 \citep{gelman2006prior}. For the Power-law kernel case,
when $a$ and/or $b$ are allowed to vary their exchangeable priors are
analogous to the exchangeable prior defined for $\psi$. Note that for
the Power-law kernel, $b$ is allowed to vary by taxon only when $a$
varies by taxon.

When $\gamma$ is allowed to vary by taxon, we define a logit-normal
prior such that the probability density function for $0 \leq \gamma_k
\leq 1$ is given by
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\sigma_\gamma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\frac{1}{ \gamma_k ( 1 - \gamma_k )}\exp \left(- \frac{(\text{logit}(\gamma_k) - \mu_{\gamma})}{2 \sigma_{\gamma}^2} \right)
\end{align} 
where $\mu_{\gamma} \sim \text{uniform}(-2, 2)$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}
\sim \text{halfCauchy}(0,5)$.

Allowing $\gamma$ and/or the kernel to vary by taxon results in a
total of 10 model variations, described in Table~\ref{table:GOF}.

\subsubsection{Model comparison}

To reduce the number of candidate models, we first assessed the
exchangeable prior variance estimates. When there was insufficient
evidence to support the case for taxon-specific parameters, as
indicated by (i) an estimated variance close to zero and (ii)
overlapping credible intervals for the posterior distributions of the
taxon-specific parameters, the model was no longer considered a
candidate model.

Then, to determine the kernel and model that best fit the data we
performed a formal model comparison using the Wantanabe-Akaike
Information Criterion (WAIC) \citep{watanabe2010asymptotic}. The WAIC
provides a relative measure of loss of information (as does the more
familiar AIC) in a Bayesian context, and accounts for the full
posterior distribution as opposed to conditioning on a single point
estimate (as in AIC and DIC) \citep{gelman2014understanding}. One of
the benefits of the WAIC is that it avoids the necessity of knowing
the number of model parameters (as required by AIC).

\subsubsection{Comparing STEPPS productivity and dispersal to
  previous estimates}

To assess our level of agreement with our current scientific
understanding of pollen dispersal and production processes, we compare
our productivity and dispersal estimates to previously published
results. We do not expect to agreement among absolute quantities; if
STEPPS is well-defined, we expect the relative ordering of taxa with
respect to both of these processes to be consistent (at least in
general) with our current understanding.

In previous pollen-vegetation studies, pollen productivity is
quantified in several ways. In linear regression models, pollen and
vegetation proportions are related according to a linear model
\citep{bradshaw1985relationships, jackson1990}. In these linear
models, the slope coefficient accounts for differences in pollen
productivity among taxa but also includes the effects of
dispersal. The degree to which these effects are confounded in the
slope coefficient depends on the nature of the vegetation sampling; in
general, the larger the area of sampled vegetation, the more likely it
is that productivity and dispersal are confounded, although we note
that this is also highly dependent on the size of the sedimentary
basin. In the Extended R-value (ERV) model, deposited pollen is a
function of nearby vegetation composition, plus a background pollen
source \citep{prentice1986, prentice1987quantitative,
  marquer2014holocene, brostrom2008pollen}. The $\alpha$-slope
coefficient that relates deposited pollen from nearby sources to
nearby vegetation measures productivity, but as in the linear
regression model, is also confounded by dispersal processes to some
degree. With the goal of quantifying unconfounded pollen productivity,
pollen dispersal biases can be removed from the $\alpha$-slope
coefficients estimated from the ERV model
\citep{sugita1999landscape}. We compare our productivity estimates
$\phi_p$ to pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) determined by each of
the above methods. For ease of comparison, each set of PPEs is
rescaled to the $[0,1]$ interval.

Comparing pollen dispersal estimates with our established
understanding of dispersal is less straightforward. In STEPPS,
dispersal is defined as the sum of locally and non-locally deposited
pollen, where the non-local pollen is distance-weighted by a dispersal
kernel. Due to this model specification, there is no single parameter
that quantifies dispersal. However, we can compute a capture radius,
i.e., the radius of the circle within which some proportion of the
total released pollen is deposited. We can use this measure as an
crude approximation of distance travelled, which is inversely related
to falling speed, at least for a fixed release height and
wind speed.

\subsubsection{Prediction model}
\label{sec:pred}

One of the common uses of a PVM is to make predictions of vegetation
composition from pollen data, typically back through time. In future
work, we will use the PVM presented here to make vegetation
composition predictions for the upper midwestern USA for the last 2000
years. Here we predict settlement-era vegetation composition to assess
our ability predict the data used to calibrate. These predictions also
allows us assess how the differences between model variants manifest
themselves in the composition estimates.

The model is similar to the calibration model, in which we defined the
relationship between vegetation composition and sediment pollen. Now
we would like to make predictions in the absence of composition data,
using the calibration process parameter estimates. The vegetation
composition now becomes an unknown parameter, with a defined spatial
structure that we assign. This assigned spatial structure comes from
the composition calibration data, and constrains the vegetation
composition by quantifying the smoothness of compositional changes on
the landscape.

More specifically, the structure of the relationship between the
pollen counts and vegetation is identical to
Equations~\ref{eq:arriving} \& \ref{eq:DM}. The underlying
composition, denoted $g$ is modelled as a Gaussian process, where for
the set of points in our domain, defined by the grid cell centers, $g$
follows a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution where
\begin{align*}
\bm{g}_p \sim \text{MVN}(\mu_p, \eta_p \, \exp(-d/\rho_p)),
\end{align*}
where $\eta_p$ and $\rho_p$ are taxon-specific spatial covariance
parameters and $\mu_p$ is the taxon-specific mean.  The covariance
paramaters $\eta_p$ and $\rho_p$ ara estimated \textit{a priori} by
fitting a Gaussian process to the settlement-era composition data.
The proportional vegetation $r_p(s)$ is linked to the underlying
corresponding spatial process $g_p(s)$ through an additive log-ratio
sum-to-one constraint
\begin{align*}
r_p(s) = \frac{ \text{exp}(g_p(s))}{ \sum_{k=1}^K \exp (g_p(s)) }.
\end{align*} 
The full prediction model (not described here) used to estimate
composition at multiple times accounts for covariance across both time
and space. 

Estimating the underlying vegetation process at each spatial location
in the Upper Midwestern domain is computationally challenging, at
least for a grid of the specified resolution. To overcome the burden
of long computational times, we use a Gaussian predictive process
model in which the process is estimated at specified knot locations
and then scaled up to the full domain (see
\cite{finley2009improving}). Here we use 120 knot locations, whose
locations are determined using the kmeans clustering algorithm
\cite{macqueen1967some}.

Settlement-era vegetation composition is estimated for the subdomain
composed of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
using the settlement-era sediment pollen calibration data set. The
Michigan Lower Peninsula is disjoint from the remainder of the domain,
and only a few pollen samples are available for this region, and it is
therefore excluded from the prediction domain in this analysis.

The dissimilarity between the predicted composition for different
underlying calibration models and the PLS data is determined by
measuring the Euclidean distance between the two sets of
multi-category outcomes at each grid cell.

More specifically, we compare the settlement-era PLS data
$\bm{r}(s_i)$ with the posterior mean of the composition estimates
obtained from the prediction model $\hat{\bm{r}}(s_i)$. Then, for
location $s_i$ the dissimilarity is
\begin{align*}
\left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} (r_p(s_i) - \hat{r}(s_i))^2 \right).
\end{align*}
This measure is analogous to the Brier score, which measures the
accuracy of probabilitic predictions
\citep{gneiting2007strictly}. Total dissimilarity is obtained for each
set of predictions by summing the dissimilarity values over all
locations.

\subsection{Numerical implementation}
\label{sec:imp}

We cannot directly sample from the joint posterior, so we rely on MCMC
methods. With the goal of achieving more efficient sampling with
respect to the effective sample size per unit time, we used the Stan
v2.6.2 statistical modeling software to estimate parameters
\citep{stan-software:2014}. Stan implements a variant of the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method called the No-U-Turn Sampler, which is
a gradient based sampling method that uses these directional
derivatives to make informed decisions about how to move along (and
sample from) the joint posterior surface \citep{hoffman2011nuts}.

The complex nature of the prediction model in combination with the
domain size make it prohibitively slow to estimate prediction model
parameters. To overcome this issue, we modified the Stan software to
have it call a function that analytically computes the model gradient,
thus avoiding the need to rely on automatic differentiation. This
modification additionally allowed us to use parallel computation via
openMP.

All scripts are made publicly available on github (link).

Ten candidate calibration models are considered; four Gaussian kernel
variants, and six Power-law kernel variants. For each model, we run
three chains using different random seeds and initial conditions with
a warm-up of 250 iterations, followed by a sampling period of 1700
iterations. Warm-up iterations are discarded and not used in further
analysis. Convergence is assessed using a potential scale reduction
factor and a multi-chain effective sample size estimator
\citep{gelman2014bayesian}.

% Our model was coded in the Stan bugs-like language, then converted
% to C++ code using the Stan translator, compiled using GCC, and run
% on an Intel XXXX.

% HMC can be more efficient that a traditional MCMC
% in many cases, but requires additional tuning that is difficult to
% perform in practice, as well as user defined gradients that can be
% difficult to impossible to compute analytically. NUTS overcomes the
% tuning issues by extending the HMC algorithm to including automatic
% tuning. Stan provides an implementation of the NUTS sampler that uses
% automatic differentiation to compute model gradients, making the
% sampler accessible to anyone able to program their model using a
% bugs-like syntax.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Expert elicitation of biostratigraphic evidence for European settlement and site suitability}

All 185 sites for which there were pollen count time series were
considered; only the before/after sites were omitted from this
exercise. The four experts were in complete agreement for 59 out of
185 sites: they all identified the same pre-settlement sample (53
cases) or agreed that no such sample could be identified (6
cases). The remaining sites varied in level of disagreement - in 79
cases, experts identified two samples; in 39 cases 3 pre-settlement
samples were identified; and in 8 cases there was no agreement. These
results confirm our hypothesis that identification of biostratigraphic
markers is subject to variability among analysts, and to our knowledge
exercise is the first to quantify this uncertainty. In
Figure~\ref{fig:elicit}, pollen diagrams for two sites illustrate that
in some cases the settlement horizon is prominent, while in other
cases it is much less so.

Of the 6 sites that experts agreed had no discernible settlement
signal, two were from Rice Lake, which is an anomalous site locally
dominated by wild rice (\textit{Zizania}), with very high grass
(\textit{Poaceae}) pollen representation; it lacks any clear
indication of settlement. The remaining four included: Rossburg peat
bog in Minnesota; Disterhaft Farm Bog in Wisconsin; Kirchner Marsh in
Minnesota; and Stewart’s Dark Lake in Wisconsin. Three of these four
sites are bogs and marshes with local marshland non-arboreal plants
growing at or near the coring location; these marshland plants may
swamp the signal from agricultural non-arboreal indicators.

Based on these results, we were faced with the challenge of
establishing criteria to determine which sites to include in the
calibration data set and where to place the settlement horizon for
each site. Ideally, the now quantified pre-settlement sample
uncertainty would be included into the modelling framework. In favor
of simplicity, for now we use a single pre-settlement sample for each
suitable site. 

%% Based on these results, we faced the challenge of establishing site
%% suitability criteria to determine which sites to include in the
%% calibration data set. Ideally, the now quantified pre-settlement
%% sample uncertainty would be included into the modelling
%% framework. Although this is surely possible, it would increase the
%% complexity of the statistical model. For the sake of simplicity, we
%% filter suitable sites and assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic
%% way based on expert determinations.

% However, this elicitation exercise varies from those that
% are typically conducted to construct priors; here we are uncertain
% about our data, not our parameters. Instead of increasing the
% complexity of the statistical model, we filter suitable sites and
% assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic way based on the expert
% determinations.

Sites were considered unsuitable if: 1) a majority of experts (more
than half) chose not to assign a pre-settlement sample (12 sites), or
2) if half of the experts chose not to assign a pre-settlement sample
and the other half identified pre-settlement samples whose estimated
ages were “far” from the approximate time of settlement (7 sites). For
this second criterion, we used existing age-depth models associated
with the pollen records. Modelled ages for the identified
pre-settlement depths were compared to 1850 AD, which serves as an
approximate year of settlement in the upper Midwest.  Modeled ages
were defined to be far from the expert-identified settlement horizon
if discrepancies were greater than 500 years. All 19 unsuitable sites
were excluded from further analysis.

We also checked the pollen records for their representativity and
possible identification errors. To reconstruct regional vegetation, we
need pollen records that represent composition representative of that
found on a larger spatial scale. However, it is likely that some sites
were sampled as a result of their (relatively speaking) unusual
composition or local setting. We identified two anomalous sites. The
first is Ocheda Lake, a large but shallow glacial kettle lake in
Southwestern Minnesota. The pollen diagrams indicate a relative spike
in red maple (\textit{Acer rubrum}) pollen in the expert-identified
settlement horizon sample. This may represent a misidentification
given that red maple is rare in southwestern Minnesota. It is possible
that this pollen comes from box elder maple (\textit{A. negundo}) or
silver maple (\textit{A. saccharinum}), which occur along streams and
lakes. Assuming that this pollen is indeed from the maple genus, we
assume that the high count is a result of a maple anther falling into
the sample. Hence, at this site we set the maple pollen count to
zero. The second anomalous site is Tamarack Creek, a tamarack bog
situated in an unglaciated wetland in the Driftless Area of western
Wisconsin. This site is characterized by unusually high tamarack
pollen counts for the top 80 cm of sediment. In particular, the sample
classified as pre-settlement is composed of 40 \% tamarack, while all
other fossil pollen sites contain a maximum of 1 \% tamarack. Tamarack
trees and pollen are known for being locally concentrated in bogs, so
we set the tamarack count to zero to remove the local signal and use
the remaining counts to represent composition from beyond the bog. We
accept that these decisions may mask some true local-scale
heterogeneity within the regional vegetation.

%% There are two anomalous sites for which the model is
%% unable to adequately account for the processes leading to the
%% (relatively speaking) unusual compositional makeup of the deposited
%% pollen. The first is Ocheda Lake, a large but shallow glacial kettle
%% lake in Southwestern Minnesota. The pollen diagrams indicate a
%% relative spike in deposited Maple pollen in the pre-settlement
%% sample. The second is Tamarack Creek, a site situated in a wetland
%% with high Tamarack pollen counts for the top 80 cm of sediment. At
%% this site, the calibration sample is composed of 40 \% Tamarack, while
%% all other fossil pollen sites contain a maximum of 1 \% Tamarack.

After completion of the elicitation exercise, a follow-up examination
revealed several cores with top samples that were older (and deeper)
than expected. Typically the age of a true core top corresponds with
the year of sampling (with some margin of error). Further
investigation uncovered that five of the cores included in our
analysis were missing core tops. (The soupy sediments just below the
sediment surface are often difficult to collect, and, depending on
time, equipment, field conditions, and study purpose, investigators
sometimes do not recover these upper sediments intact.) These errors
are a result of data errors in Neotoma, and the confusion associated
with reporting depths as being either the depth below the lake surface
or sediment surface. For Lake Mary, Green Lake, Chippewa Bog, and
Ryerse Lake, we determined that the core tops pre-date settlement, and
these sites were therefore discarded \citep{webb1971late,
  lawrenz1975}. A third site, Lake Kotiranta, had a core top
previously identified as a representative pre-settlement sample, and
this sample was retained for inclusion in the calibration data set
\citep{wright1969}. The absence of core tops at these sites have been
reported to Neotoma and the records amended
accordingly. Interestingly, for each of these cores, 1-3 experts
identified a pre-settlement sample (although to be fair, they made
this judgment based solely on the stratigraphic diagram and no
information about site characteristics, and likely assumed that the
uppermost sample was in fact a surface sample).

% After completion of the elicitation exercise, a follow-up examination
% of the stratigraphic data revealed several cores with core tops with
% dates much older than expected - typically the date of a true core top
% corresponds with the year of sampling (with some margin of
% error). Further investigation uncovered that three of the cores
% included in our analysis were missing core tops. For both Lake Mary
% and Green Lake, we determined that the core tops pre-date settlement,
% and these sites were therefore were discarded \citep{webb1971late,
%   lawrenz1975}. A third site, Lake Kotiranta, had a core top
% previously identified as a representative pre-settlement sample, and
% this sample was retained for inclusion in the calibration data set
% \citep{wright1969}. Interestingly, for each of these cores, 1-3
% experts identified a pre-settlement sample (although to be fair, they
% made this judgment based solely on the stratigraphic diagram and no
% information about site characteristics, and likely assumed that the
% uppermost sample was in fact a surface sample).

After the suitability screening, we were left with 165 time series of
pollen counts, and the question of how to assign the best estimate of
pre-settlement. Given the sample resolution and an even number of
experts, neither the mean nor the median were options. Keeping in mind
that we would rather err on the side of caution and choose a depth
that was more certainly pre-settlement (deeper) than one that
represented post-disturbance times (more shallow), we ordered the
sample depths from deepest to shallowest, and selected the second in
this list (typically the second deepest, although sometimes the
deepest when there was some agreement among experts).  The 48 records
that consist of only a core top and previously identified settlement
horizon sample were not candidates for the elicitation exercise . The
decision to include these additional data in the calibration data set
was debated - the settlement horizon samples for these cores were
identified using different methodology (and analysts) than the
remaining sites. In the end, we opted to include these samples as part
of the calibration data set, based on our confidence in the data set
and analysts and the recognition that including these sites would
result in a substantive increase in sample size. In total we had 213
settlememt era sites in the upper midwestern calibration data set and
21 sites considered inadmissable (Table~\ref{table:site-data}).

\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}

To visually assess the relationship between sediment pollen and tree
taxa, we compare pie maps that depict the relative proportions of taxa
across space (Figure~\ref{fig:pie}). In these maps the broadscale
patterns of pollen and PLS data are consistent with each other, both
capturing the major ecotones in the region.  However, there are
striking differences. First, pine dominates the pollen records for
most of the northern half of the domain. Second, in the vegetation
composition data, some regions that have higher relative abundances of
hemlock, tamarack, and maple are not apparent or much less pronounced
in the pollen data. These taxa, particularly tamarack and maple, are
generally underrepresented in pollen assemblages
\citep{webb1981estimating, bradshaw1985relationships, jackson1990}. As
expected, these maps confirm that pollen data can detect key
vegetational gradients, but that the relationship between pollen and
vegetation is complex.

To further assess spatial distributions of pollen versus PLS data, we
plot the data as heat maps by taxon. Differences in extent of these
distributions indicate pollen dispersal beyond species range
limits. For example, for both birch and pine, which are
overrepresented in pollen records \citep{webb1981estimating,
  bradshaw1985relationships, jackson1990, williams2003palynological},
the distributions of sediment pollen extend well beyond the boundaries
of those shown in the PLS data (Figures~\ref{fig:maps_pp}, columns~1
and 2).

\subsection{Modelling results}

For the ten considered calibration models, the multi-chain effective
sample sizes of the joint log posterior ranged from 11 to 2055
(Table~\ref{table:GOF}). Effective sample sizes for individual
parameters were much larger. In all ten cases, the three chains
converged to the same posterior distributions. Trace plots and the
potential scale reduction factor illustrate the efficient mixing
achieved by the sampler (not shown).

To compare among models, we first assess the estimates of the
hyperparameters for the exchangeable priors. All parameter and
hyperparameter estimates support the use of taxon-specific parameter
values, except for the power-law models that allow $b$ to vary by
taxon. In these cases, the estimated variance for the exchangeable
prior for $\log ( b )$ is small ($9\cdot 10^{-6}$ for the variable $a$
and $b$ case; $1\cdot 10^{-4}$ for the variable $a$, $b$, and gamma
case). In addition, the 95 \% credible intervals for the estimate of
$b_k$ for all $k$ overlap, supporting the conclusion that the values
of $b_k$ are not statistically different. In light of this, we omit
these two Power-law kernel variable $b$ models.

Out of the remaining eight candidate models (four Gaussian kernel
variants; four Power-law kernel variants) we compare the WAIC
(Table~\ref{table:GOF}). According to the WAIC the power law kernel
outperforms the Gaussian kernel - even the most flexible Gaussian
model (variable $\psi$ and $\gamma$) results in a WAIC that is higher
than the least flexible Power-law kernel model (base model). The power
law kernel model with variable $a$ and $\gamma$ results in the lowest
WAIC, indicating that it performs the best out of the suite of
considered models. 

In subsequent analyses, we compare the two base models (Gaussian and
Power-law), and the models with the lowest WAIC for each kernel type -
the Gaussian variable $\psi$ and $\gamma$ model and the Power-law
variable $a$ and $\gamma$ model (hereafter referred to as the variable
Gaussian and Power-law models).

In Figure~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}, the raw pollen proportions are
plotted against the vegetation proportions for each grid cell (red
crosses). The relationship between pollen and vegetation is clearly
not 1:1. In particular, some taxa, such as beech, maple, other conifer, and
tamarack, are underrepresented - they can appear in large proportion
on the landscape, but never in equally large proportion in the pollen
record. Some relationships are more difficult to characterize. For
example pine varies from sparse to abundant on the local landscape,
but is consistently abundant in pollen assemblages in the northern
half of our study area, regardless of local tree abundance.

These relationships are complicated in part because of differential
pollen production, which the calibration model accounts for by the
taxon-specific scaling parameter $\phi_k$. After scaling the local
vegetation in a cell by $\phi_k$, we compare the raw pollen
proportions with the phi-scaled vegetation
(Figure~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}; black dots). Here we show the scaled
vegetation for the variable Power-law model, but the results are
similar for the variable Gaussian and base models. Scaling by $\phi$
does improve our pollen estimates; for many taxa, the black dots have
shifted towards the 1:1 line. This is especially true for maple,
tamarack, and other conifer, suggesting that these pollen-vegetation
relationships are heavily influenced by local pollen sources. This
finding is consistent with results of \citet{jackson1990,
  jackson1991pollen} and others, which showed that pollen dispersal as well as
productivity play important roles in their underrepresentation in
pollen assemblages. However, for most of the remaining taxa the
improvement is minimal, indicating that simply scaling the local
vegetation proportions is not sufficient to predict deposited pollen.

In Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, we plot the raw pollen proportions against
both the vegetation (red crosses) and predicted pollen for the
variable Power-law model (black dots). In this case the predicted
pollen is based on the local plus non-local predictions obtained from
the full calibration model. Now that non-local dispersal has been
accounted for, the raw versus predicted pollen points fall more
closely along the 1:1 line. This indicates that, at least in our
domain, non-local dispersal processes account for much of the pollen
that arrive at any given location. For most taxa, the improvement that
we gain by using more flexible models versus the base models is not
qualitatively obvious (not shown). However, for hemlock, there is an
obvious improvement in our ability to predict sediment pollen with the
more flexible models. Both base models underpredict hemlock pollen at
sites where there are relatively high proportions of hemlock (although
hemlock pollen never exceeds 28\% at any site in our domain), but this
is not the case for the variable Gaussian and Power-law models. This
suggests that with the base models the relative contribution of local
versus non-local hemlock pollen is estimated to be less than the true
value, i.e. $\gamma$ is too small.

From each model we obtain taxon-specific estimates of pollen
productivity $\phi$ (Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). If this parameter truly
represents differential pollen production, then we expect the
estimated values to be more or less consistent across model variants,
which is generally the case (Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). However, for most
taxa, $\phi$ estimates for the variable Power-law kernel model are
larger than for the other models (although they may not be
statistically different). The estimated values of $\phi$ form three
distinct groups in $\phi$ parameter space: low, intermediate, and high
production (Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). The group of taxa with lowest
production in decreasing order are beech, maple, other conifer, and
tamarack. This low production pattern is evident in
Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, where the representation of these taxa in the
pollen records is consistently less than their representation on the
landscape (except at a few anomalous ponds). Intermediate producers,
again in decreasing order, include other hardwood, oak, elm, hemlock,
ash, and spruce. The high production group includes pine and birch,
which can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:preds} by their propensity
to be over-represented in the pollen record relative to the
landscape. These results agree in general with \citep{prentice1986},
who analyzed the pollen-vegetation relationship for sites in Wisconsin
and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In that work, pine and birch were
identified as high producers/dispersers, while maple and tamarack were
identified as low producers/dispersers. \citep{jackson1990} also found
that pine and birch were good dispersers with effective source areas
of 1000m, while maple was found to have a much smaller source area,
indicating limited dispersal.

%FIXME  \citep{williams2003palynologica}

For the base models, the local versus non-local parameter $\gamma$ was
estimated to have a mean of $0.21$ for the Gaussian kernel model and
$0.046$ for the Power-law kernel model. These values indicate that
roughly 21\% (or 5\%) of the pollen produced by vegetation in a focal
grid cell is deposited in that grid cell, while the remaining 79\% (or
95\%) disperses elsewhere in the domain.

When we allowed $\gamma$ to vary by taxon in the variable models, the
estimates for both kernels yielded similar results with overlapping 95
\% credible intervals for all taxa except pine and oak
(Table~\ref{table:gamma}). For both kernels, birch, ash, other
hardwood and other conifer all had lower estimates of $\gamma$, with
mean posterior values all less than 0.10 (mean values ranging from
0.015 - 0.088). Pine and oak estimates of $\gamma$ were also small for
the variable Power-law model ($\gamma < 0.05$), but not for the
variable Gaussian model ($\gamma > 0.2$). Both hemlock and tamarack
had larger estimated values of $\gamma$ for both models. It is
encouraging that these estimates of taxon-specific local strengths are
similar among models, but based on these estimates alone we can
compare only focal-cell contributions. Non-local dispersal is
determined by the product of $(1-\gamma)$ and the sum of the weights
of all non-local cells, which in turn depends on the estimated kernel
parameter(s).

% For the base Gaussian kernel case, the spread parameter $\psi$ was
% estimated to be $204\,(192, 215)$ km. In the variable Gaussian model
% $\psi$ estimates ranged from 152 for pine to 361 for Other
% hardwood. For many taxa, 95\% credible intervals are large; this is
% especially true for Tamarack ($\psi$ of $230\,(128, 553)$. For the
% base Power-law model, the kernel parameters $a$ and $b$ were estimated
% to be $0.01\,(0.00829, 0.02)$ and $2.03\,(2.00, 2.12)$. For the
% variable Power-law model, the estimated $b$ value was almost identical
% to the base model $2.06\,(2.00, 2.16)$. The $a$ estimates ranged from
% $0.00268$ for beech to $0.203$ for elm.

To assess how $\gamma$ and the kernel parameters affect pollen
dispersal, we plot the proportion of deposited pollen as a function of
radius from the pollen source. For a pollen source centered on the
potential source area $\Omega$, we plot $\gamma + (1- \gamma)
\sum_{s_j \neq s_i} w(s_i, s_j)$ as a function of radius from the
source where cells are included in the non-local sum if the distance
between $s_i$ and $s_j$ is less than or equal to this radius. The
weights $w(s_i, s_j)$ depend on the estimated kernel parameters, whose
quantities are not directly interpretable on their own but are
reported in Appendix~\ref{append}. For each taxon, we plot cumulative
density functions (CDFs) of deposited pollen for the four considered
models (Figure~\ref{fig:cdf}). Note that the CDFs for the base models
do not vary by taxon (solid lines).

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cdf}, the base model CDFs have two points
of intersection, indicating changing relative rates of
accumulation. The CDFs for the Gaussian kernel models all have a
sigmoidal shape, where smaller values of $\psi$ correspond with a
steeper slope indicating that relatively more pollen is deposited
close to the source. This effect can is most obvious when we contrast
the variable Gaussian CDFs for pine (lowest $\psi$) and other hardwood
(greatest $\psi$). For the variable Power-law model, for fixed $b$,
larger values of $a$ result in a more sigmoidal shape that resembles
the Gaussian kernel, as seem in the case of elm. Again for fixed $b$,
smaller values of $a$ result in a concave downward curve indicating
that more pollen is deposited closer to the source, but at a certain
distance from the source - the farthest point from the source where
the Gaussian and Power-law CDFs intersect - the cumulative pollen
deposition is equal. To condense these results, we determined the
radius from the source needed to capture 50, 70, and 90\% of the
deposited pollen for each model and each taxon
(Table~\ref{table:pollen_acc}). The 50 \% capture radius is smaller
for the Power-law base model than for the Gaussian base
model. However, the CDF for the Gaussian base model asymptotes to one
at a smaller radius than the Power-law base model (Gaussian base has a
shorter-tailed kernel). For the variable models, the 50 \% capture
radius was smallest for hemlock (60 km for the variable Gaussian; 32
km for the the variable Power-law) and largest for other hardwood (280
km for the variable Gaussian; 312 km for the variable Power-law). The
90 \% capture radii ranged from 216 km for pine to 512 km for other
hardwood for the variable Gaussian, and 380 km for elm to 608 km for
other hardwood for the variable Power-law. These values are larger
than previous estimates of source
area. \citet{williams2003palynological} estimated source area by
comparing broad- and needle-leaved pollen percentage to forest cover
obtained via remote sensing, and found that average source areas
appear to be from 25 - 75 km. \citet{prentice1987quantitative} and
\citet{bradshaw1985relationships} also estimated that for small to
medium lakes the majority of the pollen comes from a source area on
the order of 30 - 50 and 10 - 30 km respectively. Conversely,
\citet{sugita1994pollen} found that 30 \% pollen source areas were
approximately 50 - 800 metres depending on the lake size and that
vegetation sampling restricted to this area was sufficient to obtain
reliable parameter estimates. In subsequent work, however,
\citet{sugita2007theory2} noted that for most taxa, 90 - 95 \% of
pollen comes from within a source area of 100 - 400 km of the
depositional basin.

% To assess the assumption that all taxa share a dispersal kernel with
% spread controlled by the scalar $\psi$, we re-ran the model letting
% $\psi$ vary by taxon. Five of the taxon-specific 95\% credible
% intervals had some overlap with the credible intervals for the
% single-$\psi$ case, while the remaining taxa had estimated $\psi$
% value that were larger (Figure~\ref{fig:psi_vary_psi}). Elm, Tamarack,
% Maple, and Ash had the largest mean value of $\psi$, although the
% uncertainty of these estimates was large - for example, for Tamarack
% the mean value and credible interval of $\psi$ was $0.73 (0.10,
% 1.9)$. When we let $\psi$ vary by taxon, there was little effect on
% the values of $\phi$. The ordering of the taxa remained identical,
% except for a minor switch in position of Oak with Elm
% (Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). XXX: I don't get the dispersal pars
% for elm, tam, maple, ash - why are these so big?

% On average, Maple had by far the
% largest value of $\psi$, followed by Other hardwood, which implies
% that these two taxonomic groups are disperse the farthest. However,
% the 95\% credible interval for $\psi$ for Maple was wide, and in both
% cases the increased value of $\psi$ corresponded with an increased
% value of $\phi$ relative to the single-$\psi$ runs
% (Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). This indicates that there may be
% some issues with parameter identifiability inherent in the model when
% we allow $\psi$ to vary by taxon, and as such results from this run
% should be interepreted with caution.

To visualize the dispersal patterns predicted by our model, we can
estimate the proportion of deposited pollen by taxon for each grid
cell in the domain (previously, as seen in
Figures~\ref{fig:focal_scaled} and \ref{fig:preds}, we were estimating
deposited pollen only at lakes for which we had pollen data)
(Figures~\ref{fig:maps_pp}). These spatial maps help us understand how
the models treat dispersal - the predicted sediment pollen maps for
the variable Power-law model appear to be more smooth. This difference
is due in part to the increased accumulation of dispersed pollen at
short/intermediate distances relative to the variable Gaussian model
(see Figure~\ref{fig:cdf}).

We can also compare the predicted pollen maps with those depicting the
PLS data (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_pp}), remembering that the pollen
predictions have been scaled to account for differential production
(so we are comparing predicted sediment pollen with vegetation
composition). This scaling for differential production is particularly
apparent for maple. We know from the data that maple pollen
proportions are consistently lower than the vegetation proportions,
and as a result, we expect that the model will predict low amounts of
maple pollen, which it does. To see how the model predicts dispersal
by taxon, based on parameters estimated from that data, we can compare
the vegetation and pollen ranges. The effects of dispersal are
especially clear in the cases of pine and birch, where pollen
disperses well beyond the vegetation range limits.

\subsection{Comparing STEPPS productivity and dispersal to previous
  estimates}

We compared the STEPPS variable Power-law model productivity
estimates, $\phi$, to sets of published PPEs for the considered taxa
(Figure~\ref{fig:ppe}). The PPE data sets included in the comparison
were slope coefficients in either a linear regression, ERV, or
bias-corrected ERV model. These PPE estimates were also split into
geographical regions: based on the sampling locations, which were
upper midwestern USA, northeastern USA, and the European
continent. %A detailed description of the PPEs used in this comparison
%is in Appendix~\ref{append}: Table~\ref{table:XXX}. 

PPEs further from the upper midwestern USA agree less with the STEPPS
productivity estimates/rankings.  STEPPS productivity estimates are
most similar to PPEs from the upper midwest in terms of relative
rank. However, a positive linear relationship exists between STEPPS
productivity estimates and the PPEs those from the northeastern
USA. For the PPEs from the European continent the relationship is
weak, although both STEPPS and PPE estimates agree that ash, elm,
maple, and spruce are low producers. The strength of the relationship
between STEPPS estimates and PPEs is not strongly affected by the
method used to estimate the PPEs.

Next, we compared our estimated 90\% capture radius, which we defined
as the radius of the circle (centered at the pollen source) within
which 90\% of the pollen is deposited, to published values of falling
speed for trees from continental Europe and North America within the
same genus as the STEPPS taxa (Figure~\ref{fig:svs}). Capture radius
is similar to the widely used concept of pollen source area
\citep{sugita1994pollen}, but calculated from point of source rather
than point of deposition. Falling speed values used in this comparison
were obtained from the compilation of \citet{jackson1999pollen}.

%For a detailed description of the sedimentation
%velocity values used in this comparison, see Appendix~\ref{append}:
%Table~\ref{table:XXX}.

As expected, the STEPPS capture radius and falling speed are inversely
related; a lower falling speed corresponds with a greater dispersal
ability. Several taxa, however, do not fit this relationship: hemlock,
maple, and spruce. Measured falling speeds vary for these and other
taxa, both within and among laboratories and methods
\citep{jackson1999pollen}.

These comparisons provide additional support for the STEPPS model; for
both productivity and dispersal estimates, we find agreement between
STEPPS and our current understanding of these processes.

\subsection{Vegetation composition predictions}

We estimated settlement-era vegetation composition based on the
prediction model for four candidate calibration submodels (Gaussian
base and variable; Power-law base and variable). Composition was
estimated using a modified version of Stan with a warm-up period of
150 iterations, followed by a sampling period of 1000
iterations. Effective sample sizes for the joint log posterior ranged
from 209 to 400.

The predicted patterns of settlement-era composition are generally
similar across models (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_stepps_veg}) and
dissimilarities among maps are low
(Figure~\ref{fig:maps_l2}). According to the Euclidean distance, the
composition estimates obtained from the prediction model with the
underlying base Power-law calibration model are closest to the data
(Table~\ref{table:GOF}, Total distance = 1979), while the prediction
model with underlying variable Gaussian calibration model are the
farthest (Total distance = 2078).  For most taxa, the STEPPS
composition predictions (using, for illustration purposes, the
variable Power-law kernel) broadly match the compositional
distributions in the PLS data
(Figure~\ref{fig:maps_pls_stepps_sd}). As expected, the STEPPS
predictions appear smoother due to the simple dispersal kernel and the
limited number of sites for which we have pollen samples. For some
taxa, such as pine, STEPPS is able to better resolve local
heterogeneity. For taxa which are more widely dispersed, such as oak,
it is more difficult for the model to resolve local
heterogeneities. Smaller regions that are compositionally unique such
as the Big Woods in Minnesota are not well resolved by the model
(Figure~\ref{fig:maps_stepps_veg}).

The STEPPS model does not adequately predict the spatial distribution
of tamarack;the wide credible interval for estimated dispersal
indicates large dispersal parameter uncertainty
(Table~\ref{table:pollen_acc}), and tamarack in Wisconsin is highly
underpredicted (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_stepps_veg}). According to STEPPS
and others, tamarack is a relatively low pollen producer and a poor
disperser \citep{janssen1966recent}. Populations are highly
concentrated in localized settings, such as peatlands, but are rare
across the uplands. Given all this, we do not expect to observe
tamarack pollen anywhere except peatlands, and even there the tamarack
signal often will be swamped by pollen from taxa that are better
producers and/or dispersers. Since there are few pollen records from
locations that are dominated by tamarack trees, it is not surprising
that STEPPS predictive ability for tamarack is relatively poor.

\section{Discussion}

Bayesian pollen-vegetation models (PVMs) enable spatial
reconstructions of vegetation composition and estimates of key process
parameters, while accounting for data, process, and parameter
uncertainty, as well as complex spatial dependencies
\citep{paciorek2009mapping}.  Here we have furthered our understanding
of the pollen-vegetation relationship using a Bayesian hierarchical
PVM (STEPPS) calibrated with a newly developed settlement-era
vegetation and pollen datasets. STEPPS is not derived from first
physical principles, but it accounts for differential pollen
production and dispersal among taxa. One of the benefits of the STEPPS
PVM is its ability to estimate pollen-vegetation process parameters
without the need to quantify any taxon-specific attributes \textit{a
  priori}. This is in contrast to other forms of PVMs, as in the case
of LOVE and REVEALS \citep{sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2},
which requires the use of prescribed estimates of taxon-specific fall
speeds and productivity, in addition to assumptions about local
atmospheric conditions \citep{jackson1999pollen}. Despite these
differences, both PVMs have demonstrated their ability to predict
vegetation composition
\citep{soepboer2010regional,wang2011reassessment,
  overballe2013quantitative}. Continued model comparisons and
development will lead to better understanding of physical and
ecological assumptions and parameters.

In STEPPS, we make several simplifying assumptions that contribute to
process uncertainty. First, we do not account for the effects of
sedimentary basin size. Previous studies have found that sedimentary
basin size is related to pollen source area - the area from which
deposited pollen originates \citep{jacobson1981selection,
  prentice1985pollen, sugita1994pollen}. Larger basins are less
sensitive to local vegetation, and provide regional
integration. However, even the smallest basins \citep{jackson1990} and
forest-floor pollen assemblages \citep{jackson1998quantitative,
  calcote1995pollen} have a substantial long-distance component. As a
result, pollen records from larger lakes generally represent
regional-scale vegetational patterns. Recent work has shown that
regional vegetation can be inferred from smaller-sized lakes
\citep{trondmanpollen}. Here we assume composition to be constant
within each grid cell, and pollen contribution to a sedimentary basin
is determined based on the distance from the pollen sample to the
grid cell centroid. The spatial resolution of the vegetation data
prevents resolution of sub-cell heterogeneity in forest
composition. However, in future work, it should be possible to refine
the STEPPS PVM to account for and assess the importance of variable
basin size.

Second, following standard convention in Quaternary palynology, we
assume that dispersal is isometric. In reality, pollen dispersal is a
complex function of many factors, including wind direction and speed
and topographical and landscape features. Asymmetric dispersal has
been documented by \citet{robledo2005patterns} using DNA extraction to
identify parentage, and non-uniform wind fields have been incorporated
into a few PVMs \citep{bunting2005modelling}. It is theoretically
possible to account for complexities in dispersal in a PVM calibrated
using modern data. However, covariate data needed to determine
non-uniform dispersal patterns, such as wind speed and direction, are
not readily available for past times.
%dyer2007powers

Even with the simplifying assumption of isometry, dispersal-kernel
shape can vary. In these analyses, we used the Gaussian and inverse
Power-law as representative of short- and long-tailed kernel
types. Predictions based on these kernels are similar, although the
fatter-tailed inverse Power-law kernel performed slightly better than
the Gaussian. This agrees with findings by others, who found evidence
supporting the importance of long-distance pollen dispersal
\citep{austerlitz2004using, macinnis2012measuring}, although further
investigation is warranted.

Most PVMs are calibrated using modern vegetation and pollen data, and
application of these models to reconstruct past vegetation assumes
that these relationships are constant. However, European settlement
resulted in significant changes to the landscape that may influence
the pollen-vegetation relationship \citep{kujawa2015,
  st2014bias}. This influence does not affect our ability to calibrate
PVMs using modern data, but suggests that quantitative reconstructions
of past composition based on the assumption of constancy of the
pollen-vegetation relationship may be improved by using settlement-era
calibration data \citep{kujawa2015}. In future work, we plan to
address this question by quantifying the differences in STEPPS
composition reconstructions based on modern versus settlement-era
calibration data for the upper midwestern domain.

Confidently estimating placement of the EuroAmerican settlement
horizon and other biostratigraphic events remains an underappreciated
source of uncertainty and potential bias in paleoecology. Soliciting
expert opinion has become an increasingly common way to assign
parameter priors in Bayesian statistics
\citep{choy2009elicitation}. Here, we use expert elicitation to
identify the settlement-era horizon in the pollen data, with the goal
of reducing expert bias. Experts were in complete agreement for
approximately a third of the pollen sites, and differed for
two-thirds, indicating substantial uncertainty in identifying
biostratigraphic signals in fossil pollen records. Further
investigation can be undertaken to determine the effects of these
uncertainties on calibration parameters and vegetation
reconstructions, although in this work we do not account for
uncertainty associated with the settlement-era pollen sample
selection.

The STEPPS PVM outperforms vegetation predictions based on raw pollen
counts alone, as well as those based simply on scaling using pollen
productivity factors (Figures~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}
and~\ref{fig:preds}). Pine and birch are estimated to have the highest
pollen productivities, consistent with prior productivity estimates
\citep{bradshaw1985relationships, prentice1986}. In these STEPPS
estimates, long-distance dispersal plays a major role in determining
pollen assemblages in the upper midwest domain. For some taxa, such as
pine and birch, the variable Power-law model estimates that 2\% of the
dispersed pollen remains within an 8 km grid cell, while the remainder
is dispersed outside the grid-cell. For other taxa, such as hemlock,
27\% of the pollen remains local.

Our pollen capture-radius estimates are large compared to prior
estimates
\citep{sugita2007theory2,sugita1994pollen,williams2003palynological,prentice1987quantitative,bradshaw1985relationships};
source-area radii required to account for 90 \% of the pollen are on
the order of hundreds of kilometres. A comparison of the PLS and
pollen data (Figure~\ref{fig:pie}) shows evidence of
long-distance-dispersal over large distances (e.g. high pine pollen
abundances far outside the area of highest pine tree abundances). The
difference between STEPPS and previous source area estimates may be in
part a consequence of the 8 km spatial resolution of our vegetation
data, which does not allow us to resolve within-grid-cell
heterogeneity and the effects of local populations near depositional
environments \citep{jacobson1981selection, bradshaw1985relationships,
  jackson1990}. The importance of spatial resolution on source area
estimates has been previously noted
\citep{sugita1994pollen}. Multi-scale analyses testing the impacts of
spatial resolution on pollen-source area are needed to provide further
insight to this potential sampling artifact and to better understand
pollen dispersal and source area.

The STEPPS PVM is able to reproduce regional patterns of settlement
vegetation for most taxa, but with some smoothing attributed to the
dispersal kernel (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_pp}). Tamarack is the sole
taxon not well-modeled by STEPPS; the poor performance for tamarack is
attributable to its low pollen production, poor pollen dispersal, and
highly localized distribution.

Overall, our application of STEPPS has demonstrated its ability to
reconstruct regional patterns of vegetation in the upper midwestern US
from networks of fossil pollen data, while providing new insights into
the key processes governing pollen-vegetation relationships and
parameter estimates for those processes. Given ability to predict
vegetation composition at the time of calibration, it should become
possible to infer past forest composition robustly from fossil pollen
data, and thereby better understand the processes that determined past
forest dynamics during the changing climates and land use of the
Holocene and Anthropocene.
