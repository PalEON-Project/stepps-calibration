\section{Introduction}

Understanding forest ecosystems of the past can provide us with
valuable information about how ecosystems respond to biotic and
abiotic factors. In particular, mapping forests back through time
offers new information not only about the climate-forest relationship,
but also forest-atmosphere interactions. In order to quantify forest
ecosystem change through time, we need spatio-temporal data. There is
no forest data that extends back through the last several millenia,
but there is a wealth of paleo-data, including fossil pollen data,
that serves as a proxy for surrounding vegetation. To make use of this
data to estimate past forest composition relies on our ability to
quantify the pollen-vegetation relationship. 

The complexity of the pollen-vegetation relationship has made it a
long-studied question in the paleoecological literature. Different
taxa produce different amounts of pollen, and XXX Describe some of the
research here....

Sampling to quantify pollen-vegetation relationships usually involves
collecting surface sediment samples to obtain pollen counts at the
time of sampling, as well as a survey of vegetation composition and
abundance of the surrounding forests. Inference can then be made about
processes that affect pollen production, dispersal, and deposition,
but only for the time of sampling. Due to widespread land-use change,
it is likely that these relationships have not remained static back
through time.

Here we use the awesome PLS data set...

To calibration the pollen-veg relationship against the PLS forest
composition data set requires that we identify pollen samples that
date back to pre-settlement. Raw fossil pollen data records depths and
counts. Usually there are additional radiocarbon dates for some number
of macrofossils scattered along the cores, not necessarily aligned
with sampled depths. These radiocarbon dates constrain age estimates,
and although radiocarbon dating facilities do assign dating errors, it
is important to keep in mind that macrofossil dates may not be exactly
aligned with dates of sediment pollen from the same depth
\cite{XXX}. To infer age as a function of depth requires an age-depth
model, although there is no consensus on the most appropriate
model. Recently, the community has recognized that importance of
estimating uncertainty, and a Bayesian age-depth model coined Bacon
developed by \cite{XXX }which does just that has gained momentum.
  
In addition to radiocarbon dates, other constraining geological
markers can often be identified from looking at stratigraphic plots of
pollen proportions.


In the case where samples are taken at multiple sites, pollen counts
are rarely modelled in a spatial context. Here we use a spatial
Bayesian hierarchical model of pollen counts at a network of sites
developed by \cite{XXX}.


\section{Data}

\subsection{Spatial domain}
Our study area is the upper Midwestern US, and includes Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan. The lower peninsula of
Michigan was not included because: 1) it is spatially disjoint from
the rest of the domain; and 2) the public land survey forest data is
still in the process of being digitized, so the composition data
available is incomplete.

\subsection{Tree taxa}
We focus on a subset of taxa that are of particular interest,
inlcuding the most abundant taxa and any taxa that are of specific
ecological importance. Our modelled taxa includes: Ash, Beech, Birch,
Elm, Hemlock, Maple, Oak, Pine, Spruce, Larch, as well as Other
Conifer and Other Hardwood groups which include those respective tree
types not explicitly included in the aforementioned list of taxa. This
separation of other hardwood and conifers as opposed to having a
single other group was motivated by ecological modellers who are often
interested in grouping taxa as deciduous, conifer, and deciduous
conifers. Additionally, the separation of other hardwood and conifers
allows the model to treat each group seperately and tease out inherent
differences between conifer and deciduous seed production, although we
recognize that the variability in production and dispersal within each
of these groups is still large.

\subsection{Public Land Survey (PLS) data}

%XXX Jack and Simon 
Prior to major European settlement, the US General Land Office
conducted a Public Land Survey (PLS) throughout much of the United
States in order to simplify the sale of federal lands. Surveyors
documented section location using trees as landmarks, and recorded
genus or species, diameter, and location (azimuth and distance from
corner). This data set provides a systematic survey of the forest
before settlement, and has been used by foresters, ecologists, and
historians to understand ecosystem and land-use change through
time. In the Upper Midwest, the survey was conducted during
XXXX-XXXX. Due to the slow-growing nature of temperate forests,
including those in the Upper Midwest, we can think of the PLS data as
a snapshot of forest composition in time. 
%This is a unique data set that allows us better understand forest ecosystems

%XXX Chris...  
Survey data for the Upper Midwest has been recently digitized, and
aggregated to an 8km square grid \cite{XXX}. As a result of the
sampling methodology, this aggregation results in small numbers of
tree counts per grid cell. To overcome the variability arising from
this we work with a smoothed version of the PLS data, based on a
Bayesian spatial multinomial model \cite{XXX}. 

\subsection{Pollen data}
With the push for robust and reproducible research from the scientific
community, paleoecoinformatics has responded with the development of
tools that make accessing and using large datasets possible. One such
tool that has made this work possible is the Neotoma database
(\url{neotomadb.org}; \cite{XXX}), which stores a variety of types of
paleoecological data, including pollen data. Accessing this data can
be done using the Neotoma API (), or using the R neotoma package
\cite{XXX}. Using these tools granted us access to 176 fossil pollen
cores falling within our domain.

%XXX: Jack or Simon, anything to add here about this dataset?
In addition to the data obtained from Neotoma, we also had access to a
data set belonging to Calcote, Hotckiss, XXX. This data set included
57 cores in our domain. Of these 57, 9 were long cores (analogous to
those from neotoma), while the remaining 48 had only core top and
pre-settlement samples (at least in the data file we had access to).

Associated with each of the cores is a table containing counts by
taxon for a series of depths. These counts are not certain -
classifying pollen grains based on morphological features and relating
them to plant taxa is often challenging as a result of (differential)
preservation. Counts between palynologists for a single sample will
also differ, but for experts this difference should be negligible
\cite{XXX}.

One of the challenges that arises when working with pollen data
collected by several (or more) individuals is dealing with naming
inconsistencies in the pollen taxonomies between sites. Both differing
nomenclature and identified taxonomic resolution require that care be
taken when standardizing pollen taxonomies. There arise cases where it
may not be possible to associate certain pollen grains with plant
taxa, and in these cases grains may be identified to type
(e.g. Alnus-type), or placed into a group whose name is defined by
their morphology (e.g. tricolporate). In this study, decisions
regarding these poorly identified pollen grains were made on a
case-by-case basis, although the total number of grains that fell into
these ambiguous classes were few.

For each pollen core we are interested in the pre-settlement sample
that is closest in time to the PLS data. Typically, age-depth models
are used to assign ages to sample depths. However, there are many
different types of age-depth models, each with its own set of benefits
and shortcomings. Instead, we rely on a panel of experts to interpret
patterns in the pollen count data to identify pre-settlement sample
estimates. All long cores were suitable for this exercise.

\subsection{Expert elicitation of pre-settlement depth}
Widespread land clearance that occurred during European settlement
provided habitat for certain non-arboreal colonizers, resulting in
increases in non-arboreal pollen in the sediment. In the Upper
Midwest, significant increases in Ambrosia, Rumex, or Poaceae are
typically coincident with this settlement horizon. When these
increases can be identified based on pollen count data, we can
identify this settlement horizon, and in particular what we call the
pre-settlement sample - the sample that falls immediately before these
increases in agricultural indicator species. In practice, identifying
increases in agricultural indicators is often difficult, when
possible, and can be subjective. 

For this study, in the interest of reducing uncertainty, we want to:
1) identify pre-settlement samples using consistent methodology, and
2) assess the variability in assignment of pre-settlement among
analysts. To address these questions, we asked a team of expert
palynologists to identify the pre-settlement sample for 185 pollen
records (176 from Neotoma and 9 from the Calcote data set). Experts
were provided with pollen diagrams depicting proportional changes
through time as a function of depth for key indicator species and the
ten most abundant arboreal taxa, and were prohibited from relying on
stratigraphic dates (radiocarbon or other) or age-depth model
estimates of sample age. In the case that there was no distinguishable
pre-settlement sample, experts were instructed to report NA. In the
case that experts were uncertain about their pre-settlement sample
assignment, they were instructed to note this, with or without
justification. 

Results from this exercise will define depths associated with
pre-settlement samples. Pollen counts associated with these depths
will then become part of our calibration data set.

\section{Calibration model}

Here we describe the Bayesian hierarchical calibration model used to quantify the
pollen-vegetation relationship. 

We treat space as a regular grid composed of 8 km square grid cells,
which is the resolution defined by the PLS data. The grid is composed
of discrete cells, but the underlying vegetation composition and
dispersal spatial processes are assumed to be smooth. Spatial cells
are indexed by $s=1,\ldots,S$, where $S=8013$.

\subsection{Model description}

Trees are sources of pollen - they produce and distribute pollen
across the landscape. Here, the gridded PLS data provides us with a
representation of how these trees are distributed throughout the Upper
Midwest domain. We can then think of grid cells as being producers of
pollen, and the amount of pollen produced by a given grid cell
depends on the compositional makeup of that cell (among other things). 

Pollen produced by vegetation within each grid cell can be deposited
locally within that same grid cell, or can be dispersed into the neighborhood around that grid cell.
cells. For a focal grid cell $s_i$, the pollen produced by taxon
$p$ within that cell that remains local is described by

\begin{align}
\gamma \phi_p r_p(s_i)
\end{align} 

where $\gamma$ is the proportion of pollen produced in $s_i$ that is deposited locally,
$\phi_p$ is the scaling factor that accounts for differential
production, and $r_p(s_i)$ is the proportional abundance of vegetation
in $s_i$.

The remaining proportion ($1-\gamma$) of pollen produced in $s_i$ is
dispersed to other grid cells according to an isotropic dispersal
kernel centered at $s_i$. The dispersal kernel weights all pollen
dispersing away from the focal cell as a function of the distance from
$s_i$ to any neighboring cell $s_k$ by $w(s_i, s_k)$. 

 Here we test two
dispersal kernels: (i) gaussian and (ii) inverse power-law. The
gaussian kernel is often used as a reference against more leptokurtic
kernels such as the inverse power law kernel, and can represent
dispersal through diffusion. Both kernels have been successfully
applied to pollen data \ref{XXX}.

The gaussian kernel, denoted $w_g(s_i,s_k)$, is written as
\begin{align}
w_g(s_i, s_k) = \exp\left( - \frac{d(s_i, s_k)^2}{\psi^2} \right),
\end{align}
where $d(s_i,s_k)$ defines the distance between cells $s_i$ and $s_k$
and $\psi>0$ is a parameter that describes the spread of the kernel. 

The inverse power-law kernel, denoted by $w_{pl}(s_i,s_k)$, is given by
\begin{align}
w_{pl}(s_i, s_k) = \frac{(b-2)(b-1)}{2 \pi a^2} \left( 1 + \frac{d(s_i, s_k)}{a} \right)^{-b},
\end{align}
where $a>0$ and $b>2$ are parameters that determine the shape of the kernel. 

As expected, the weight assigned by both kernels is a decreasing function
of distance - less pollen is distributed farther away.

%Previous work has shown that pollen dispersal distances can reach up to XXXX, and that long-distance dispersal events may be rare, but have the ability to drive range expansion XXX.
 
We can then define the pollen produced by taxon $p$ dispersing from
$s_i$ to $s_k$ by
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p r_p(s_i) w(s_i, s_k),
\end{align}
where $C$ is a normalizing constant equal to the sum of the weights of
all the cells to which pollen can be dispersed, defined be a
rectangular region that covers and extends beyond the limits of the domain.

%% An anisotropic kernel may better approximate true pollen dispersal due to prevailing winds, although prevailing wind direction in the Upper Midwest is not constant throughout the domain due to the proximity to the great lakes, making the inclusion of this asymmetry complicated. %

%and therefore including this non-constant asymmetry in the modeling framework is not straightforward. 

So far we have described the model from a source-based perspective,
describing how pollen produced in grid cells is dispersed. What we
really want is to model the pollen arriving at the grid cell in which
a pond lies $s(i)$ - we have counts of pollen that arrived at
lakes. To do this, we simply sum all the contributions that have been
dispersed to $s(i)$, which includes both the locally deposited pollen
plus the pollen dispersed to $s(i)$ from all other grid
cells in the domain. Therefore the pollen from taxon $p$ arriving at $s(i)$ is given
by

\begin{align}
\gamma \phi_p r(s(i)) + \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p \sum_{s_k \neq s(i) } r(s_k) w(s(i), s_k).
\label{eq:arriving}
\end{align}

Finally, we need to relate the \ref{eq:arriving} to the pollen count data. To do this, we must consider that the pollen data are overdisperse - the counts are more variable than we might expect if we assumed they followed a  multinomial distribution. This overdispersion is the result of differential production and dispersal, but is also an artifact of comparing counts at a point location falling somewhere within any focal grid cell with grid-based average vegetation. To account for this, we model the pollen counts at pond $i$, denoted by $\bm{y}_i$, as
dirichlet-multinomial where 
\begin{align}
\bm{y}_i \sim DM (n_i, \bm{\alpha}_i).
\label{eq:DM}
\end{align}
The precision $\alpha_i$ is equal to the sum of \ref{eq:arriving} over all taxa
\begin{align}
\alpha_i = \sum_{p=1}^K \gamma \phi_p r(s(i)) + \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi \sum_{s_k \neq s(i) } r(s_k) w(s(i), s_k).
\label{eq:alpha}
\end{align}
This precision parameter $\alpha$ is also affected by how close a lake is to the domain boundary. Since we do not have data outside of our domain, for any lake that falls close to a boundary we will miss including some of the pollen contributions from the vegetation growing outside the domain. The repercussion of this is that the local pollen is up-weighted because the sum of the weights of the grid cells contributing to a grid cell near the boundary is much less than the sum of the weights of the total potential neighborhood defined by C (see \ref{eq:alpha}. 

\subsection{Numerical implementation}

We cannot directly sample from the joint posterior, so we rely on MCMC
methods. With the goal of achieving more efficient sampling with
respect to the effective sample size per unit time, we used the Stan
statistical modeling software to estimate parameters. Stan implements
a variant of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method called the No-U-Turn
Sampler, which is a gradient based sampling method that uses these
directional derivatives to make informed decisions about how to move
along (and sample from) the joint posterior surface.

% Our model was coded in the Stan bugs-like language, then converted
% to C++ code using the Stan translator, compiled using GCC, and run
% on an Intel XXXX.

% HMC can be more efficient that a traditional MCMC
% in many cases, but requires additional tuning that is difficult to
% perform in practice, as well as user defined gradients that can be

% tuning issues by extending the HMC algorithm to including automatic
% tuning. Stan provides an implementation of the NUTS sampler that uses
% automatic differentiation to compute model gradients, making the
% sampler accessible to anyone able to program their model using a
% bugs-like syntax.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Expert elicitation of pre-settlement depth and site suitability}

Four experts participated in the elicitation exercise. For 59 out of
185 sites, the experts were in total agreement: they all identified
the same pre-settlement sample (55 cases) or were in agreement that no
such sample could be identifed (4 cases). The remaining sites varied
in level of disagreement - in 79 cases, experts identified two
pre-settlement samples; in 38 cases there were 3 pre-settlement
samples identified; and in 4 cases there was no agreement. Without
further analysis, these results confirm our assumption that
identification of biostratigraphic markers is subject to variability
between analysts. 

Of the 4 sites that experts agreed had no discernible settlement
signal, two of these sites were at Rice Lake, which is an anomalous
site overwhelmed by a Zizania and Poaceae signal, and does not show
any indication of settlement. 

Based on these results, we were subsequently faced with the challenge
of establishing site suitability criteria to determine which sites to
include in the calibration data set. Ideally, the now quantified
pre-settlement sample uncertainty would be included into the modelling
framework. Although this likely possible, it would increase the
complexity of the statistical model. For the sake of simplicity, we
filter suitable sites and assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic
way based on the expert determinations.

% However, this elicitation exercise varies from those that
% are typically conducted to construct priors; here we are uncertain
% about our data, not our parameters. Instead of increasing the
% complexity of the statistical model, we filter suitable sites and
% assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic way based on the expert
% determinations.

Sites were considered unsuitable if: 1) the majority chose not to
assign a pre-settlement sample, or 2) if half of the experts chose not
to assign a pre-settlement sample and the remaining half identified
pre-settlement samples whose modelled ages were far from the
approximate time of settlement. There were 11 sites for which a
majority of experts (3 or 4) did not assign a pre-settlement sample,
indicating no consensus regarding the existence of a land-clearance
signal. As such, these sites were deemed unsuitable for
calibration. For our second criterion, we looked to existing age
models associated with our pollen cores. Modelled ages for the
identified pre-settlement depths were compared to 1850, which serves
as an approximate year of settlement in the upper midwest. Uncertainty
associated with age estimates from age-depth models can be large, but
there is also a tendency for us identify patterns when in fact there
are none \cite{XXX}. This criterion is a crude way to try to account
for the phenomenon.  There were seven sites for which half of the
experts did not assign a pre-settlement sample and the other half
identified depths whose estimated ages were more than 500 years away from
1850. All unsuitable sites were excluded from further analysis.

After completion of the elicitation exercise, a more thorough
examination of the stratigraphic data used to calibrate age models, we
noticed that several cores had core tops with dates much older than
expected. Further investigation revealed that three of the cores
included in our analysis were missing core tops. Core tops for both
Lake Mary and Green Lake pre-date settlement, and therefore were
discarded. The third core for Lake Kotiranta had a core top
corresponding to the pre-settlement sample, and was retained for
inclusion in the calibration data set. Interestingly, for each of
these cores, 1-3 experts identified a pre-settlement sample (although
to be fair, they likely made the assumption that the uppermost sample
was in fact a surface sample). 

The additional 48 short cores in the Calcote data set were not candidates for
the elicitation exercise because they had only a core top and a
pre-settlement sample recorded. We comtemplated their inclusion in our
calibration data set because their pre-settlement samples are
identified using different methodology (and analyst) than the
remaining sites. We opted to include these samples, based on our
confidence in the data set/analyst and the recognition that including
these sites would result in a substantive increase in sample size.

After suitability screening, we were left with 165 long cores plus 48
additional short cores, for a total of 213 calibration.

XXX: How did we choose the depths?

\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}

To visually assess the relationship between sediment pollen and tree
taxa, we compare pie maps which depict the relative proportions of
taxa across space (Figure~\ref{fig:pie}). If the patterns were
identical, then the relationship between vegetation and pollen would
be 1:1, i.e. the pollen and vegetation proportions would be identical
to each other at each location. We know this is not the case, but we
need to assess how they are different from this 1:1 ideal. In the pie
maps the patterns are consistent with each other, although there are
some striking differences. First, we see that pine dominates the
pollen records for most of the northern half of the domain. Second, in
the vegetation composition data, we see regions that have higher
relative abundances of Hemlock, Tamarack, and Maple that are not
apparent or much less pronounced in the pollen data. There are more
subtle differences between the pollen and vegetation maps in the less
abundant taxa. As expected, these pictures confirm that the
relationship between sediment pollen and vegetation is complex. Note
that the PLS pie map represents an aggregated version of the 8km
gridded dataset, and that this coarsened data set is used for
exploratory purposes only (pies would not be visible if the original
scale were used).

\subsection{Modelling results}

Three chains were run for with a warmp-up of 250 iterations, followed
by a sampling period of 10,000 iterations. Warm-up iterations were not
used in further analysis. For a total of 30,000 iterations, the
effective sample size of the joint log posterior was XXX. Trace plots
for the joint log posterior show the efficient mixing achieved by the
sampler \ref{XXX}.

Parameter estimates from the calibration model run allow us to
quantify the relationship between the sediment pollen and the
vegetation on the landscape. In particular, we are interested in
learning whether sediment pollen from a network of sites can be used
as a proxy for vegetation composition at large spatial scale. An
intuitive way to think about the pollen-vegetation relationship is to
plot the proportion of sediment pollen against the proportion of
vegetation, by taxon. We know this relationship is complicated, and
the hope is that the calibration model allows us to better predict
sediment pollen than if we tried to predict based on data alone. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}, we plot the raw pollen proportions
against the vegetation proportions for each grid cell. The
relationship between the pollen and vegetation is clearly not 1:1. In
particular, we see that some taxa, such as beech, maple, other
conifer, and tamarack, are not prolific pollen producers - they can
appear in large proportions on the landscape, but do never appear in
large proportion in the pollen record. (Note that it could also have
been the case that the produced pollen may have been abundant, but
travelled elsewhere.) We also point out that some relationships are
difficult to identify, for example pine, where it varies from being
sparse to abundant on the local landscape, but this provides little
indication about the relative abundance of pine pollen.

Differential pollen production is one of the reasons these
relationships are complicated - in the model, this is accounted for by
the scaling parameter $\phi$. After scaling the vegetation in the pond
cell by $\phi$, we can compare the raw pollen proportions with these
pollen predictions (\ref{fig:focal_scaled}). Scaling by $\phi$ does seem to improve our pollen estimates; for many taxa, the black points have shifted towards the 1:1 line. However, the improvement is minimal, indicatins that something is still missing.

In Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, we again plot raw pollen against the
vegetation or predicted pollen by taxon, but here the predicted pollen
is based on the local plus non-local predictions obtained from the
full calibration model. Now that dispersal has been accounted for, we
see that the raw versus predicted pollen points fall more closely
along the 1:1 line. This indicates that in this region, dispersal
processes account for much of the pollen that we see - scaling the
local vegetation to account for differential production was not
sufficient to predict deposited pollen. The model is less succesful at
predicting Hemlock pollen. In Figure~\ref{fig:preds}. we see that the
model underpredicts the pollen at sites where there is a high
proportion of Hemlock. This suggests that pollen dispersing to these
sites is estimated to make a larger contribution to the sediment
pollen than it should for this taxon.

XXX There are several cases where the model does not do a good job   

Taxon-specific estimates for the production/dispersal parameter $\phi$
form two distinct groups in $\phi$ parameter space: low to
intermediate, and high $\phi$ or production/dispersal
(Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). The group of taxa with lowest
production/dispersal in decreasing order are Hemlock, Beech, Maple,
Other Conifer, and Tamarack. This low production/dispersal pattern is
evident in Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, where the representation of these
taxa in the pollen records is consistently less than their
representation on the landscape (except at a few anomalous ponds). The
high production/dispersal group includes pine and birch, which can
also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:preds} by their propensity to be
over-represented in the pollen record relative to the landscape. All
other taxa fall into the intermediate production/dispersal region of
the spectrum. These results agree in generel with estimates of the
pollen-vegetation relationship based on sites in Wisconsin and the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan found by \cite{prentice1986}. In that
work, Pine and Birch had the largest slopes (top
producers/dispersers), and maple and tamarack as limited
producers/dispersers. \cite{jackson1990} also found that Pine and
Birch were good dispersers with effective source areas of ~1000m,
while Maple was found to have a much smaller source area indicating
limited dispersal.

The local versus non-local weight $\gamma$ was estimated to have a
mean of $0.20\,(0.19, 0.22)$. This indicates that 20\% of the pollen
produced by vegetation in a focal grid cell is deposited in that grid
cell, while the remaining 80\% disperses elsewhere in the domain. The
dispersal kernel specifies the weights that determines where the
pollen goes, and depends on the spread parameter $\psi$ which was
estimated to be $210\,(200, 220)$ km. This implies that 50\% of the
pollen produced in a focal cell is deposited within 140 km of the
focal cell, and 90\% is deposited within 296 km of the focal cell \ref{fig:dvd}.

XXX: Move me somewhere else!
To better assess spatial distributions of pollen versus PLS data, we
can plot the data as heat maps by taxon. Differences in extent of these
distributions are indicative of successful pollen dispersal. For
example, for both Birch and Pine, we see that the distributions of
sediment pollen extend well beyond the boundaries of those shown in the PLS
data (Figures~\ref{fig:maps_compare_pine} \& \ref{fig:maps_compare_birch}). 

To assess the assumption that all taxa share a dispersal kernel with
spread controlled by the scalar $\psi$, we re-ran the model letting
$\psi$ vary by taxon. Five of the taxon-specific 95\% credible
intervals had some overlap with the credible intervals for the
single-$\psi$ case, while the remaining taxa had estimated $\psi$
value that were larger (Figure~\ref{fig:psi_vary_psi}). Elm, Tamarack,
Maple, and Ash had the largest mean value of $\psi$, although the
uncertainty of these estimates was large - for example, for Tamarack
the mean value and credible interval of $\psi$ was $0.73 (0.10,
1.9)$. When we let $\psi$ vary by taxon, there was little effect on
the values of $\phi$. The ordering of the taxa remained identical,
except for a minor switch in position of Oak with Elm
(Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). XXX: I don't get the dispersal pars
for elm, tam, maple, ash - why are these so big?

% On average, Maple had by far the
% largest value of $\psi$, followed by Other hardwood, which implies
% that these two taxonomic groups are disperse the farthest. However,
% the 95\% credible interval for $\psi$ for Maple was wide, and in both
% cases the increased value of $\psi$ corresponded with an increased
% value of $\phi$ relative to the single-$\psi$ runs
% (Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). This indicates that there may be
% some issues with parameter identifiability inherent in the model when
% we allow $\psi$ to vary by taxon, and as such results from this run
% should be interepreted with caution.


To visualize the dispersal patterns predicted by our model, we can
estimate deposited pollen for each grid cell in the domain (previously
we were estimating deposited pollen only at lakes for which we had
pollen data) (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_pollen}). These spatial maps help
us understand how the model treats dispersal. We can compare the maps
of predicted relative pollen abundance with those depicting the
relative tree abundance (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_veg}), remembering that the pollen predictions have
been scaled for differential production. This scaling for differential
production is particularly apparent for Tamarack. We know from the
data that Tamarack pollen proportions are always lower than the
vegetation proportions, and as a result, we expect that the model will
predict low amounts of Tamarack pollen, which it does. To see how the
model predicts dispersal by taxon, based on parameters estimated from
that data, we can compare the vegetation and pollen ranges. The
effects of dispersal are especially clear in the Pine and Oak cases,
where we see pollen dispersing well beyond the range limits of the
vegetation range boundaries.
