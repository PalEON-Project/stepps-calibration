\section{Introduction}
Understanding past forest composition and change provides valuable
information about ecosystem response to biotic and abiotic factors at
timescales outside the realm of most direct ecological observations
\citep{jackson2007looking}. In particular, in a world of changing
climates, reconstructing past shifts in tree distributions and forest
composition provides new information about climatic processes
governing forest distributions and dynamics \citep{goring2015a},
forest responses to climatic changes \citep{williams2009rapid}, and
vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks \citep{matthes2015}. The fossil pollen
records extracted from lakes and mires are our primary source of data
about prehistoric forest composition. Rigorous estimates of past
forest composition and dynamics from these records relies on our
ability to quantify the pollen-vegetation relationship.

Key challenges to quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation from
pollen data are 1) the complex nature of the pollen-vegetation
relationship and 2) the heavy anthropogenic imprint on contemporary
plant communities. The processes governing pollen production,
transport, and deposition have been the subject of palynological study
for decades \citep{tauber1965, jacobson1981selection,
  jackson1994pollen, jackson1999pollen, sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2, prentice1988records}. The pollen found in lakes
and mires usually arrives by wind, coming from plants that vary in
their pollen productivity, dispersal, and pollination syndrome. Some
plant taxa are highly overrepresented in sedimentary archives while
others are underrepresented or absent. A wide variety of
pollen-vegetation models (PVMs) have been developed including
modern-analog based approaches \citep{williams2003variations},
linear-regression \citep{webb1981estimating,
  bradshaw1985relationships}, extended R-values
\citep{parsons1981statistical, sugita1994pollen, sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2} and, most recently, Bayesian hierarchical models
\citep{paciorek2009mapping, garreta2010method}.  In these models,
pollen dispersal can be assumed constant \citep{davis1963theory,
  parsons1981statistical}, modeled as a simple inverse-square or other
function \citep{webb1981estimating, calcote1995pollen,
  jackson1998quantitative}, or parameterized using various
pollen-transport models \citep{prentice1988records, sugita2007theory1,
  sugita2007theory2, jackson1999pollen}. Here, as in
\citet{paciorek2009mapping}, a Bayesian hierarchical approach is used
to model pollen counts from a network of ponds as a function of
gridded forest composition data, taking into account pollen dispersal
(from both local and regional vegetation), differential pollen
production, and process uncertainty. A hierarchical model as
implemented here allows information to be borrowed across space to
estimate governing parameters at a regional scale, and to estimate
uncertainty associated with these parameters.

The spatial scale for which we can infer past forest composition is
variable, and depends in part on the grain and extent of the forest
composition data we use to calibrate the PVM. Some PVMs deal with
highly spatially resolved pollen dispersal events (REFS), while others
are more coarse in nature (REFS). Model structure is motivated by
question at hand - a model built to help understand the physics of
pollen transport requires different tools than one whose goal is to
estimate the functional response between vegetation and deposited
pollen across locations. In this work, our spatial scale is large in
both grain and extent relative to most other PVMs, which reflects our
motivation to estimate forest composition at a regional scale. As
such, we do not aim (and will not be able) to resolve deposition
events or composition heterogeneity at scales smaller than the grain
size determined by our grid cell size. However, we can infer
composition at a coarser scale, over a large extent, which informs us
about broad compositional shifts across space and time.

Some PVMs, notably the LOVE/REVEALS family of models
\citep{sugita2007theory1, sugita2007theory2}, are calibrated using
information about pollen productivity and dispersal properties for
individual species and diffusion-based models of particulate transport
[e.g., \citet{prentice1985pollen}]. Other PVMs are calibrated against
spatial networks of pollen assemblages extracted from surface sediment
samples, which are then cross-referenced to contemporary spatial
datasets of vegetation composition and abundance of the surrounding
forests. These cross-referenced pollen and vegetation datasets are
then used to make inferences about the processes that affect pollen
production, dispersal, and deposition at the time of
sampling.  Extending any inference about these processes to times prior
to the time of sampling requires the assumption that pollen-vegetation
relationships are constant.

This assumption seems reasonable at first approximation; although tree
taxa may vary in their productivity and dispersal both in space and
time, the relative differences among taxa should be less variable
\citep{parsons1981statistical}.  However, in view of the magnitude of
both compositional and structural modification of vegetation by human
land-use in the past two centuries, this assumption merits serious
investigation and testing.  Human land-use might have altered
vegetation-pollen relationships in at least four ways.  First, the
modern landscape of the northeastern US consists of fragmented forests
interspersed with open areas.  Although the pre-European landscape was
also patchy (disturbances, lakes, wetlands, villages, cultivated
areas), a much larger and more widespread fraction of the landscape
consists now of unforested ‘arboreal-pollen desert’ (REF).  Second,
because most forests of the region are now secondary, they may differ
in density, biomass, size-structure, and age-structure
\citep{rhemtulla2009legacies}.  Third, land clearance, forest
management practices, and successional processes have led to
fundamental changes in forest composition (REF).  For example, Populus
and Acer are more abundant than in the 19th century.  Finally, the
overall pattern of forest mosaics in the region may be different – in
some cases more spatially homogeneous (e.g., forest management
practices) but in others more heterogeneous (e.g., locally
idiosyncratic disturbance legacies) (REF).

These changes in forest composition, structure, and landscape pattern
may have had direct influences on pollen production and dispersal.
Pollen production, for example, may be greater for trees growing in
the open or at forest edges.  Pollen dispersal is affected by
properties of both the forest canopy and the land surface
\citep{jackson1999pollen}.  A more serious issue for pollen/vegetation
relationships may be that at the landscape level, contemporary forests
have no historical analogues. Pollen-vegetation relationships are
complicated by the Fagerlind effect, in which relative pollen
representation of one taxon is affected by that of all other taxa
contributing to an assemblage \citep{prentice1988records}.  Although
the Fagerlind effect can be corrected for \citep{prentice1986,
  jackson1995exploration}, empirical corrections are contingent on
particular vegetational contexts \citep{jackson1998quantitative}.

To date, few studies have examined presettlement pollen/vegetation
relationships using quantitative vegetation data
\citep{schwartz1989predicting}.  However, pollen-based paleoclimate
reconstructions differed significantly depending on whether a modern
or a pre-settlement pollen-data set was used in the calibration
\citep{st2014bias}.  The development of quantitative presettlement
vegetation reconstructions for the western Great Lakes region
\citep{goring2015b}, together with the existence of numerous pollen
profiles with presettlement pollen assemblages (www.neotomadb.org),
provides an opportunity to develop an alternative pollen/vegetation
calibration framework, focused on the early to mid-19th Century.  In
this paper, we calibrate a PVM for a time period that predates
European settlement, thereby avoiding the effects of settlement,
agriculture, and industrialization.

Vegetation from pre-EuroAmerican settlement in the upper midwestern
United States is based on US Public Land Survey (PLS) records
collected by surveyors prior to European settlement
\citep{bourdo1956review, schulte2001original,
  almendinger1996minnesota}. The PLS mapped the United States west and
south of Ohio to provide a systematic 1$\times$1 mi grid for the sale
of public lands \citep{stewart1935public, white1983history}. At
section corners surveyors would place a stake as the official location
marker, and then record the closest two to four trees, measuring
distance to point center, diameter and the (often idiosyncratic)
common name of these trees \citep{mladenoff2002narrowing}.  These
point-level data were then standardized and aggregated, across the
upper Midwest to a 64km$^2$ grid (8$\times$8 km) on an equal-area
Albers projection (proj4: +\textit{init}=\textit{epsg}:3175) to
account for changing survey instructions through time (cf. Stewart,
1935) and to provide sufficient spatial resolution for regional scale
analysis \citep{goring2015b}.

Pollen assemblages represent the cell walls of pollen released from
forest plant communities preserved within a depositional environment.
Pollen assemblages are obtained by coring depositional environments
including lakes, mires, and forest hollows, among other locations. To
calibrate a PVM against PLS forest composition data, prior to major
anthropogenic disturbance, requires pollen samples that are
contemporaneous with the pre-settlement era. Contemporaneous pollen
assemblages are identified largely using estimated age of the pollen
sample. Sample age is obtained from a chronology constructed using
classical \citep{blaauw2010methods} or Bayesian
\citep{blaauw2011flexible, buck1999bcal, blaauw2005radiocarbon,
  ramsey1995radiocarbon} methods using dated material including
radiocarbon (${}^{14}C$) and other radiometric dates (e.g. $^{210}$Pb,
$^137$Cs). Chronologies are developed using dated stratigraphic
control points from within a cores, which may be geochronological
(dated material), geostratigraphic (e.g., the ``modern'' core top),
and sometimes biostratigraphic (changes in pollen assemblages
associated with dated changes on the landscape). Geochronological
control points are dated using radiometric dating (typically
radiocarbon, but sometime lead-210), although these dates are
uncertain due to analytical errors during the laboratory radiocarbon
dating process \citep{ward1978procedures}, the conversion of
radiocarbon to calendar years \citep{reimer2013intcal13}, and
potential differences between age of macrofossil material and age of
sediment \citep{blois2011methodological}. Geostratigrahic markers may
have fewer sources of uncertainty - the core top age is assumed to be
the year of sampling, although sedimentary mixing of the upper
sediment during sampling does introduce some uncertainty. Finally,
biostratigraphic control points are determined by examination (usually
visual) of changes in pollen assemblages throughout a core. However,
time series of pollen counts are noisy, and in practice identifying
changes in composition is both difficult and subjective. Even once a
compositional change is identified, there is uncertainty: related to
the chronological/stratigraphic sampling density
\citep{liu2012temporal}, and related to the need to assign a single
year to the landscape-scale phenomenon which caused this compositional
shift.

Age estimates of pollen samples, and in some cases their uncertainty,
can be estimated using an age-depth model determined by a combination
of the chronological controls. To determine which sample best
represents pre-settlement times, it is possible to select the sample
closest in age but not younger than the time of settlement. Instead,
we rely on the existence of a biostratigraphic signal corresponding
with the time of interest.

During European settlement, land-clearances led to noticeable
increases in certain agricultural indicators that is reflected in the
pollen records, especially Ambrosia \citep{mcandrews1988human}. This
change in the relative abundance of Ambrosia, referred to as the
\textit{Ambrosia rise}, can be used to identify a reasonably
representative presettlement assemblage that justifiable precedes
major land clearance - here the pre-settlement pollen sample is
defined to be the sample immediately prior to the first pollen sample
that reflects the Ambrosia rise. We deal with some of the uncertainty
associated with the identification of a biostratigraphic marker by: 1)
avoiding the need to assign a date to our representative
pre-settlement assemblage, and 2) using expert elicitation to reduce
expert bias.

In this work, we refine and calibrate a Bayesian hierarchical PVM,
based on the STEPPS model \citep{paciorek2009mapping}, using newly
developed settlement-era pollen and vegetation calibration datasets
for the Upper Midwest. Specific advances include the building of a
pre-settlement era identification of pre-settlement pollen samples
from pollen time series through expert elicitation and the testing and
comparison of two standard isometric dispersal kernels. We apply
modelling results to develop new estimates of relative pollen
productivity and source area, assess the relative importance of local
and non-local pollen sources, and compare these results to prior
estimates of source area and pollen productivity.

\section{Data}

\subsection{Spatial domain}

Our study area is the upper Midwestern US, including Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan.  This region includes two major ecotones: the
``Tension Zone'' between northern mixed forests and temperature
broadleaved deciduous forests (\textit{sensu}
\citet{curtis1959vegetation})and the prairie/forest/savanna ecotone.
Both of these ecotones have been heavily modified by contemporary land
use \citep{goring2015b}.


\subsection{Public Land Survey (PLS) data}
Prior to major European settlement, the US General Land Office
conducted a Public Land Survey (PLS) throughout much of the United
States to simplify the sale of federal lands. Surveyors documented
section locations using trees as landmarks, and recorded genus or
species, diameter, and location (azimuth and distance from
corner). This data set provides a systematic survey of the forest
before settlement, and has been used by foresters, ecologists, and
historians to understand ecosystem and land-use change through
time. In the Upper Midwest, the survey was conducted during 1834-1907
\citep{stewart1935public}. Due to the slow-growing nature of temperate
forests, including those in the Upper Midwest, we can think of the PLS
data as a snapshot of forest composition in time.

Survey data for the Upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan)
has been digitized and aggregated to a 64 km$^2$ grid
\citep{goring2015b}. This aggregation results in an average count of
134 trees per grid cell, a low count, but because of the uniform
spatial sampling the ecological patterns and regional structure of the
dominant forest taxa are clear \citep{goring2015b}. To overcome
local-scale variability arising from the raw gridded PLS dataset an
intrinsic conditional autoregressive model was applied to the raw
dataset to borrow strength across space, providing both estimates of
the counts, but also uncertainty estimates, provided from the regional
vegetation pool \citep{paciorek2015}.

\subsection{Tree taxa}

\citet{goring2015b} report fifteen tree taxa directly, and the full
dataset contains 28 taxa, most resolved to the level of genera,
although the dataset also includes ``No Tree'' when surveyors did not
find a tree within a reasonable distance, ``Unknown Tree'' when the
common name used to identify the tree could not be resolved, and
``Other Hardwood'' when the surveyed tree was clearly a hardwood, but
could not be resolved beyond that level. We focus on a subset
representing two functional groups (Deciduous and Coniferous taxa) and
10 tree genera that includes the most abundant taxa as well as
less-abundant taxa of particular ecological importance. Our modelled
taxa are: \textit{Acer}, \textit{Betula}, \textit{Fagus},
\textit{Fraxinus}, \textit{Larix}, \textit{Picea}, \textit{Pinus},
\textit{Quercus}, \textit{Tsuga}, \textit{Ulmus} (see
Table~\ref{table:gamma} for the common name translations). Among the
remaining 16 taxa are aggregated to ``Other Conifer'' and ``Other
Hardwood'' groups. The separation of other hardwood and conifers
allows the calibration model to treat ecological group separately,
teasing out inherent differences between conifer and deciduous pollen
production, although variability in production and dispersal within
each group is large.

\subsection{Pollen data}

Advances in paleoecoinformatics have made it possible to easily access
and query large datasets using tools such as the multi-proxy
Pliocene-Quaternary database Neotoma (\url{neotomadb.org}). The
development of the Neotoma API has allowed the development of both a
map-based search interface - the Neotoma Explorer
(http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/) - and the neotoma package for R
\citep{goring2015}. We identified 176 sedimentary pollen records in
the Neotoma database within the Upper Midwest. To be included each
record was required to include several pollen samples within the last
2000 years.  An additional 57 cores, not available from Neotoma prior
to this project, were contributed by independent researchers
\citep{kujawa2015}. The new records included 9 longer records and 48
records for which data was only available from the core top and
pre-settlement assemblages, hereafter referred to as before-after
records.

Classifying pollen grains based on morphological features and relating
them to plant taxa is labour intensive and highly skilled as a result
of (differential) preservation of taxa \citep{havinga1964,
  havinga1984}. In addition, each pollen count represents a sample
from a larger population \citep{maher2012assessment,
  maher1981statistics}. However, uncertainty from pollen grain
classification and counting is negligible \citep{webb1978sensing,
  webb1978mapped}. 

Working with data collected by independent researchers requires the
standardization of pollen taxonomies to deal with differing
nomenclature and taxonomic resolution. Taxonomies were standardized
using a translation table based on the table used in \url{neotoma}
\citep{goring}, which is reported as supplemental material.

\subsection{Identifying the EuroAmerican settlement horizon in pollen records via expert elicitation}

Age-depth modelling of sediment requires assumptions about
depositional processes that can be difficult to quantify, resulting in
potentially uncertain age-depth predictions. Instead, we rely on a
panel of experts to interpret patterns in the pollen count data in
order to identify representative pre-settlement samples at each of the
185 fossil pollen sites for which we have count time series.

Widespread land clearance during European settlement provided habitat
for many ruderal plants, resulting in increases in non-arboreal taxa
in pollen time series \citep{mcandrews1988human}. In the Upper
Midwest, significant increases in ragweed (\textit{Ambrosia}), docks
and sorrels (\textit{Rumex}), and grasses (\textit{Poaceae}) typically
mark this settlement horizon. Here we use expert elicitation to
identify the representative pre-settlement sample - the sample that
falls immediately before these increases in agricultural indicator
species. All expert elicitation relies on judgement. Additional
uncertainty in pre-settlement sample identification varies widely
among sites as a result of the chronological density of pollen
samples, time-averaging of sediments, the rapiditay of forest
clearance and landscape transformation, and the pollen representation
of dominant trees, which can dampen or amplify the \textit{Ambrosia}
signal. At some sites, the settlement horizon is unambiguous, while at
others the transition is less clear (see Figure~\ref{fig:elicit}).

For this study, in the interest of reducing uncertainty, we want to:
1) identify pre-settlement samples using consistent methodology, and
2) assess the variability in assignment of pre-settlement among
analysts. To address these questions, we asked a team of expert
palynologists to identify the pre-settlement sample for 185 pollen
records. Experts were provided with pollen diagrams depicting
proportional changes through time as a function of depth for key
indicator species and the ten most abundant arboreal taxa. Experts
were prohibited from relying on stratigraphic dates (radiocarbon or
other) or age-depth model estimates of sample age. In the case that
there was no distinguishable pre-settlement sample, experts were
instructed to report NA. In the case that experts were uncertain about
their pre-settlement sample assignment, they were instructed to note
this, with or without justification. Results from this exercise are
used to define depths associated with pre-settlement samples. Pollen
samples associated with these depths are placed into our calibration
data set.

\section{Calibration model}

Here we describe the Bayesian hierarchical calibration model used to
quantify the pollen-vegetation relationship. For the sake of clarity,
we first provide an overview of the model, and then introduce the
mathematical notation.

The pollen counts that we observe are a function of the vegetation on
the landscape - the composition and abundance of trees on the
landscape determines (in part) the composition and abundance of pollen
that is deposited in the sediment. Determining how much pollen the
surrounding vegetation contributes is a complex function of forest
characteristics (e.g. composition, structure, patchiness, spatial
stationarity) , climate (including wind), grain size and morphology,
topography, and proximity of the vegetation to a deposition basin.

We work on a grid defined by the resolution of the gridded PLS data,
and define each deposition site as having both local and non-local
pollen contributions. Local contributions are made by the vegetation
within the same grid cell as a site, and non-local contribution are
made by vegetation from all other grid cells in the domain. The
relative contributions of the local and non-local contributions are
determined by a model parameter, with the restriction that the sum of
all contributions from the pollen source area must sum to one.

Contributions from non-local grid cells are not all equal - their
relative contributions are weighted using a dispersal kernel, which
determines how likely it is for pollen to travel from one grid cell to
another. Dispersal kernels are typically isometric, meaning that they
depend only on the distance of the tree to the pond, and not the
absolute position or direction. In reality, dispersal may not be
isometric, owing to prevailing wind directions during the
pollen-dispersal seasons, regional topography, surface roughness, and
vegetation patchiness on the landscape. However, isometric dispersal
kernels are a reasonable and widely used approximation, because
turbulent atmospheric mixing below the boundary layer tends to smooth
out anisotropies.

Here we test two dispersal kernels: the Gaussian and the Inverse
power-law. The Gaussian kernel is often used as a reference against
more leptokurtic kernels such as the Inverse power law kernel, and can
represent dispersal through diffusion. Although the Gaussian kernel
has simpler mathematical representation, fatter-tailed kernels (such
as the Inverse power-law) in general perform better than those with
thinner tails (like the Gaussian or Exponential) when modelling pollen
dispersal \citep{devaux2007modelling, austerlitz2004using}. However,
dispersal data needed to validate pollen dispersal models are
generally unavailable, especially at the large spatial scales needed
to adequately test long-tailed kernels \citep{clobert2012dispersal}.

Here, we choose two kernels that are representative of the short- and
long-tail kernel classes, and compare between these generalized
functional forms.

%  Both the gaussian and inverse power law kernels have
% been successfully applied to pollen data ??.  

To determine the total non-local contribution, we sum the
contributions of all grid cells in the domain that do not contain a
given pond, where a contribution is equal to the weight assigned by
the kernel multiplied with the vegetation proportion at that grid
cell. Then, we sum the local and non-local contributions to obtain a
single vector of proportions that represent the effective contributing
vegetation. Finally, each component of this vector is scaled by a
taxon-specific parameter ($\gamma$) that accounts for differential
production of pollen among plant species.

This work lays the methodological foundation for rigorous
reconstruction of past forest composition from fossil pollen data and
all scripts are made publicly available at GitHub (link).

\subsection{Model description}

As previously mentioned, the spatial domain is defined as a regular
grid composed of 8 km square grid cells. The grid is composed of
discrete cells, but the underlying vegetation composition and
dispersal spatial processes are assumed to be smooth. Spatial cells
are indexed by $s=1,\ldots,S$, where $S=8013$.

Pollen produced by vegetation within each grid cell can be deposited
within that grid cell, or can be dispersed into the neighborhood
around that grid cell. For a focal grid cell $s_i$, the pollen
produced by taxon $p$ within that cell that remains local is described
by

\begin{align}
\gamma \phi_p r_p(s_i)
\end{align} 

where $\gamma$ is the proportion of pollen produced in $s_i$ that is deposited locally,
$\phi_p$ is the scaling factor that accounts for differential
production, and $r_p(s_i)$ is the proportional abundance of taxon $p$
in $s_i$.

The remaining proportion ($1-\gamma$) of pollen produced in $s_i$ is
dispersed to other grid cells according to an isotropic dispersal
kernel centered at $s_i$. The dispersal kernel weights all pollen
dispersing away from the focal cell as a function of the distance from
$s_i$ to any neighboring cell $s_k$ by $w(s_i, s_k)$. 

The two dispersal kernels considered here are: (i) the Gaussian and
(ii) the Inverse power-law.

The Gaussian kernel, denoted $w_g(s_i,s_k)$, is written as
\begin{align}
w_g(s_i, s_k) = \exp\left( - \frac{d(s_i, s_k)^2}{\psi^2} \right),
\end{align}
where $d(s_i,s_k)$ defines the distance between cells $s_i$ and $s_k$
and $\psi>0$ is a parameter that describes the spread of the kernel. 

The Inverse power-law kernel, denoted by $w_{pl}(s_i,s_k)$, is given by
\begin{align}
w_{pl}(s_i, s_k) = \frac{(b-2)(b-1)}{2 \pi a^2} \left( 1 + \frac{d(s_i, s_k)}{a} \right)^{-b},
\end{align}
where $a>0$ and $b>2$ are parameters that determine the kernel shape. 

As expected, the weight assigned by both kernels is a decreasing function
of distance - less pollen is distributed farther away.

%Previous work has shown that pollen dispersal distances can reach up to XXXX, and that long-distance dispersal events may be rare, but have the ability to drive range expansion XXX.
 
We can then define the pollen produced by taxon $p$ dispersing from
$s_i$ to $s_k$ by
\begin{align}
(1-\gamma) \phi_p r_p(s_i) w(s_i, s_k).
\end{align}

% We can then define the pollen produced by taxon $p$ dispersing from
% $s_i$ to $s_k$ by
% \begin{align}
% \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p r_p(s_i) w(s_i, s_k),
% \end{align}
% where $C$ is a normalizing constant equal to the sum of the weights of
% all the cells to which pollen can be dispersed, defined be a
% rectangular region that covers and extends beyond the limits of the domain.

%% An anisotropic kernel may better approximate true pollen dispersal due to prevailing winds, although prevailing wind direction in the Upper Midwest is not constant throughout the domain due to the proximity to the great lakes, making the inclusion of this asymmetry complicated. %

%and therefore including this non-constant asymmetry in the modeling framework is not straightforward. 

So far we have characterized the model from a source-based
perspective, describing how pollen produced in grid cells is
dispersed. We would like to quantify the pollen arriving at pond $i$
located in the grid cell $s(i)$ - our data is counts of pollen grains
that have been deposited in the sediment. This arriving pollen is
equal to the sum of the contributions from all cells in the domain to
the pollen pool in $s(i)$, which includes both the locally deposited
pollen plus the pollen dispersed to $s(i)$ from all other grid cells
in the domain. Therefore the pollen from taxon $p$ arriving at pond
$i$, referred to as $r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}}$, is given by
\begin{align}
r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}} = \gamma \phi_p r_p\bigl(s(i)\bigr) + \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p \sum_{s_k \neq s(i) } r_p(s_k) w\bigl(s(i), s_k\bigr),
\label{eq:arriving}
\end{align}
where $C$ is a normalizing constant equal to the sum of the weights of
all the cells to which pollen can be dispersed, defined be a
rectangular region that covers and extends beyond the limits of the
domain.

Finally, we need to relate the arriving pollen $r_{i,p}^{\text{pol}}$
quantified in Equation~\ref{eq:arriving} to the pollen count data. To
do this, we must consider that the pollen data are overdispersed - the
counts are more variable than we might expect if they were assumed to
follow a multinomial distribution. This overdispersion is mostly
attributed to heterogeneity in the pollen production and dispersal
processes that is not accounted for in our mathematical
characterization, but is also an artifact of comparing pollen counts
at a point location (the pond) situated anywhere within a focal grid
cell to a grid-based vegetation composition average. To account for
this overdispersion, we model the pollen counts at pond $i$, denoted
by $\bm{y}_i$, as dirichlet-multinomial (DM), which is a compound
distribution used to account for overdispersion in multinomial count
data (and tends to the multinomial distribution in the case of no
overdispersion). We have that
\begin{align}
\bm{y}_i \sim DM (n_i, \bm{r}_i^{\text{pol}})
\label{eq:DM}
\end{align}
and $\bm{r}_i^{\text{pol}} = (r_{i,1}^{\text{pol}}, \ldots,
r_{i,K}^{\text{pol}})$.  The precision $\alpha_i$ is equal to the sum
of (\ref{eq:arriving}) over all taxa
\begin{align}
\alpha_i = \sum_{p=1}^K \Bigl[\gamma \phi_p r_p\bigl(s(i)\bigr) + \frac{1}{C} (1-\gamma) \phi_p \sum_{s_k \neq s(i) } r_p(s_k) w\bigl(s(i), s_k\bigr)\Bigr].
\label{eq:alpha}
\end{align}
The precision parameter $\alpha_i$ is also affected by the proximity
of a lake to the domain boundary. We do not have data outside of the
defined domain, so cannot quantify the pollen dispersed from
vegetation outside the domain to lakes situated close to the
boundary. The repercussion of this is that the sum of the weights of
the grid cells contributing pollen to a focal cell close to the domain
boundary is less than the sum of the weights of the total potential
contributing neighborhood, defined as C. As a result of having a
reduced contributing neighborhood, the local pollen contribution is
effectively up-weighted relative to the non-local contribution (see
Eqn.~\ref{eq:alpha} ).

\subsection{Model priors}

We assign uninformative uniform priors to model parameters over wide
intervals. We define the priors $\phi_k \sim \text{uniform}(0, 300)$ for
$k=1, \ldots, K$ and $\gamma \sim \text{uniform}(0,1)$. In the case of the
Gaussian kernel we define the prior $\psi ~ \text{uniform}(0, 2)$, while in
the power law kernel case we have $a ~ \text{uniform}(0, 500)$ and
$b~\text{uniform}(2, 100)$.

\subsection{Model variants}

As described above, neither dispersal kernel ($w_{pl}$ or $w_g$) nor
the parameter $\gamma$ vary by taxon. In this base variant, a single
dispersal kernel defines how all pollen disperses, and a single
parameter determines what proportions of total pollen of any given
taxon remains local. We know that in reality pollen dispersal varies
with taxon, because pollen-grain morphology, size, and weight, and
release mechanism all vary systematically among plant taxa
\citep{jackson1999pollen}. Here, we let the data inform us as to
whether there is sufficient evidence to support taxon-specific
dispersal kernels and localness parameters through the use of
exchangeable priors ?. So, we define the same prior distribution on
each of the $K$ parameters in question, where the prior distribution
is defined by shared hyperparameters. In the case where the variance
hyperparameter is estimated to be relatively close to zero, we can
conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that the
parameter of interest varies by taxon.

For example, in the Gaussian kernel case we would like to know
if there is enough support to warrant taxon specific values of
$\phi$. We define the exchangeable priors for taxon $k=1, \ldots, K$
\begin{align}
\log(\psi_k) \sim \text{normal}( \mu, \sigma)
\end{align}
where the prior on $\mu$ is uniform over the log of the prior interval
used in the single-taxon case for $\psi$, and the prior for $\sigma$
is a half-Cauchy with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 2. In the
Power law kernel case, when we let $a$ and/or $b$ vary, their
exchangeable priors are analogous to the $\psi$ case. Note that in the
Power law case, $b$ is allowed to vary by taxon when $a$ varies by taxon.

In the variable gamma case, we define a logit-normal prior for each
$\gamma_k$, where $\mu_{\gamma} \sim \text{uniform}(-2, 2)$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}
\sim \text{Cauchy}(0,5)$ defined on $[0,\infty)$.

Allowing $\gamma$ and/or the kernel to vary by taxon results in a
total of 10 model variations as described in Table~\ref{table:WAIC}.

\subsection{Model comparison}

To identify the set of candidate models, we first assessed the
variance estimates for the exchangeable priors. In the case where
there was insufficient evidence to support the case for taxon-specific
parameters, as indicated by (i) an estimated variance close to zero
and (ii) overlapping credible intervals for the posterior
distributions of the taxon-specific parameters, the model was not
considered as a candidate model.

Then to determine which kernel and model best fit the data set we
perform a formal model comparison using the Wantanabe-Akaike
Information Criterion (WAIC) \citep{watanabe2010asymptotic}. The WAIC
provides a relative measure of loss of information (as does the more
familiar AIC) in a Bayesian context, avoiding the necessity of
determining the number of model parameters (as required by AIC) while
accounting for the full posterior distribution as opposed to
conditioning on a single point estimate (as in AIC and DIC)
\citep{gelman2014understanding}.

\subsection{Numerical implementation}

We cannot directly sample from the joint posterior, so we rely on MCMC
methods. With the goal of achieving more efficient sampling with
respect to the effective sample size per unit time, we used the Stan
statistical modeling software to estimate parameters
\citep{stan-software:2014}. Stan implements a variant of the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method called the No-U-Turn Sampler, which is
a gradient based sampling method that uses these directional
derivatives to make informed decisions about how to move along (and
sample from) the joint posterior surface \citep{hoffman2011nuts}.

% Our model was coded in the Stan bugs-like language, then converted
% to C++ code using the Stan translator, compiled using GCC, and run
% on an Intel XXXX.

% HMC can be more efficient that a traditional MCMC
% in many cases, but requires additional tuning that is difficult to
% perform in practice, as well as user defined gradients that can be
% difficult to impossible to compute analytically. NUTS overcomes the
% tuning issues by extending the HMC algorithm to including automatic
% tuning. Stan provides an implementation of the NUTS sampler that uses
% automatic differentiation to compute model gradients, making the
% sampler accessible to anyone able to program their model using a
% bugs-like syntax.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Expert elicitation of biostratigraphic evidence for European settlement and site suitability}

Four experts participated in the elicitation exercise. For 59 out of
185 sites, the experts were in total agreement: they all identified
the same pre-settlement sample (53 cases) or agreed that no such
sample could be identified (6 cases). The remaining sites varied in
level of disagreement - in 79 cases, experts identified two samples;
in 39 cases 3 pre-settlement samples were identified; and in 8 cases
there was no agreement. These results confirm our hypothesis that
identification of biostratigraphic markers is subject to variability
between analysts and is the first to quantify this uncertainty. In
Figure~\ref{fig:elicit}, pollen diagrams for two sites illustrate that
in some cases the settlement horizon is clear, while in others, there
is ambiguity.

Of the 6 sites that experts agreed had no discernible settlement
signal, two of these sites were at Rice Lake, which is an anomalous
site overwhelmed by a wild rice (\textit{Zizania}) and grass
(\textit{Poaceae}) signal, and does not show any indication of
settlement. The remaining four included: Rossburg peat bog in
Minnesota; Disterhaft Farm Bog in Wisconsin; Kirchner Marsh in
Minnesota; and Stewart’s Dark Lake in Wisconsin. Three of these four
sites are bogs and marshes with local marshland non-arboreal plants
growing at or near the coring location; these marshland plants may be
swamping the signal from agricultural non-arboreal indicators.

Based on these results, we were subsequently faced with the challenge
of establishing site suitability criteria to determine which sites to
include in the calibration data set. Ideally, the now quantified
pre-settlement sample uncertainty would be included into the modelling
framework, but this option was rejected in favor of simplicity of the
statistical model. Accordingly, we set rules for filtering suitable
sites and assigning pre-settlement depths on expert determinations.

%% Based on these results, we faced the challenge of establishing site

% However, this elicitation exercise varies from those that
% are typically conducted to construct priors; here we are uncertain
% about our data, not our parameters. Instead of increasing the
% complexity of the statistical model, we filter suitable sites and
% assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic way based on the expert
% determinations.

Sites were considered unsuitable if: 1) a majority chose not to assign
a pre-settlement sample (12 sites), or 2) if half of the experts chose
not to assign a pre-settlement sample and the remaining half
identified pre-settlement samples whose modelled ages were “far” from
the approximate time of settlement (7 sites). For this second
criterion, we looked to existing age-depth models associated with the
pollen cores. Modelled ages for the identified pre-settlement depths
were compared to 1850 AD, which serves as an approximate year of
settlement in the upper Midwest.  Modeled ages were defined to be far
from the expert-identified settlement horizon if discrepancies were
>500 years All 19 unsuitable sites were excluded from further
analysis.

We also considered the representativeness of the pollen records. To
reconstruct vegetation at a regional scale, we need pollen records
that represent composition representative of what we would find on a
larger spatial scale. However, it is likely that some sites were
sampled as a result of their (relatively speaking) unusual
compositional makeup. We identified two anomalous sites. The first is
Ocheda Lake, a large but shallow glacial kettle lake in Southwestern
Minnesota. The pollen diagrams indicate a relative spike in deposited
\textit{Acer rubrum} pollen in the sample identified as being
representative of pre-settlement composition. This is likely a
misidentification - \text{Acer rubrum} is not found in Southwestern
Minnesota. It is possible that this pollen comes from \textit{Acer
  negra}, however this species is also uncommon, occuring only along
riverbeds. Assuming that this pollen is indeed from the genus
\textit{Acer}, we assume that the high count is a result of an
\textit{Acer} falling into the sample. As such, at this site we set
the \textit{Acer} pollen count to zero. The second anomalous site is
Tamarack Creek, a Tamarack bog situated in an unglaciated wetland in
what is know as the Driftless Area of western Wisconsin. This site is
characterized by unusually high Tamarack pollen counts for the top 80
cm of sediment. In particular, the sample classified as pre-settlement
is composed of 40 \% Tamarack, while all other fossil pollen sites
contain a maximum of 1 \% Tamarack. Tamarack bogs are not common in
this region, so we set the \textit{Larix} count to zero to remove the
local signal, and use the remaining counts to represent copmosition
from beyond the bog.

%% There are two anomalous sites for which the model is
%% unable to adequately account for the processes leading to the
%% (relatively speaking) unusual compositional makeup of the deposited
%% pollen. The first is Ocheda Lake, a large but shallow glacial kettle
%% lake in Southwestern Minnesota. The pollen diagrams indicate a
%% relative spike in deposited Maple pollen in the pre-settlement
%% sample. The second is Tamarack Creek, a site situated in a wetland
%% with high Tamarack pollen counts for the top 80 cm of sediment. At
%% this site, the calibration sample is composed of 40 \% Tamarack, while
%% all other fossil pollen sites contain a maximum of 1 \% Tamarack.

After completion of the elicitation exercise, a follow-up examination
of the stratigraphic data revealed several cores with core tops with
dates much older than expected - typically the date of a true core top
corresponds with the year of sampling (with some margin of
error). Further investigation uncovered that three of the cores
included in our analysis were missing core tops. For both Lake Mary
and Green Lake, we determined that the core tops pre-date settlement,
and these sites were therefore were discarded \citep{webb1971late,
  lawrenz1975}. A third site, Lake Kotiranta, had a core top
previously identified as a representative pre-settlement sample, and
this sample was retained for inclusion in the calibration data set
\citep{wright1969}. Interestingly, for each of these cores, 1-3
experts identified a pre-settlement sample (although to be fair, they
made this judgment based solely on the stratigraphic diagram and no
information about site characteristics, and likely assumed that the
uppermost sample was in fact a surface sample).

After the suitability screening, we were left with 165 long cores. For
many cores, there was no consensus, which left us to determine how to
assign our best estimate of pre-settlement. Given the sample
resolution and an even number of experts, neither the mean nor the
median were options. Keeping in mind that we would rather err on the
side of caution and choose a depth that was more certainly
pre-settlement (deeper) than one that represented post-disturbance
times (more shallow), we ordered the sample depths from deepest to
shallowest, and selected the second in this list (typically the second
deepest, although sometimes the two largest sample depths were equal).
The additional 48 before-after records were not candidates for the
elicitation exercise (they consist of only a core top and
pre-settlement sample). The decision to include this additional data
in the calibration data set was debated - the pre-settlement samples
for these cores were identified using different methodology (and
analysts) than the remaining sites. In the end, we opted to include
these samples as part of the calibration data set, based on our
confidence in the data set and analysts and the recognition that
including these sites would result in a substantive increase in sample
size. In total we had 213 pollen samples in the Upper Midwest
settlement-era calibration data set.

\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}

To visually assess the relationship between sediment pollen and tree
taxa, we compare pie maps which depict the relative proportions of
taxa across space (Figure~\ref{fig:pie}). In these maps the broadscale
patterns are consistent with each other, with both pollen and PLS data
capturing the major ecotones in the region
\citep{solomon1985computer}.  However, there are some striking
differences. First, pine dominates the pollen records for most of the
northern half of the domain. Second, in the vegetation composition
data, some regions that have higher relative abundances of Hemlock,
Tamarack, and Maple are not apparent or much less pronounced in the
pollen data. These taxa are known to be underrepresented in the pollen
record \citep{XXX}. As expected, these pictures confirm that pollen is able
to capture key vegetational gradients, but that the relationship
between pollen and vegetation is complex.

To further assess spatial distributions of pollen versus PLS data, we
plot the data as heat maps by taxon. Differences in extent of these
distributions indicate pollen dispersal beyond species range
limits. For example, for both birch and pine, both of which are known
to be overrepresented in pollen records, the distributions of sediment
pollen extend well beyond the boundaries of those shown in the PLS
data (Figures~\ref{fig:compare_maps_PINE} \&
\ref{fig:compare_maps_BIRCH}).

\subsection{Modelling results}

%\subsubsection{Posterior sampling and model selection}
A total of ten models were considered - four with the Gaussian kernel,
and six with the power-law kernel. For each model, three chains were
run with a warm-up of 250 iterations, followed by a sampling period of
10,000 iterations. Warm-up iterations were not used in further
analysis. For a total of 30,000 iterations per model, the effective
sample sizes of the joint log posterior ranged from 12,247 for the
Gaussian kernel base model to XXXX for the XXX model. Effective sample
sizes for the joint log posterior and parameter posteriors are given
in Table~\ref{XXXX}. Trace plots for the joint log posterior show the
efficient mixing achieved by the sampler (See Figure~\ref{fig:trace}
for trace plots from the Gaussian dispersed model; trace plots of
other models show similar mixing, and are therefore omitted).

To compare among models, we first assess the estimates of the
hyperparameters for the exchangeable priors. All parameter and
hyperparameter estimates support the use of taxon-specific parameter
values, except for the power-law models which allow $b$ to vary by
taxon. In these cases, the estimated variance for the exchangeable
prior for $\log ( b )$ is small (9e-6 for the variable $a$ and $b$ case;
1e-4 for the variable $a$, $b$, and gamma case). In addition, the 95 \%
credible intervals for the estimate of $b_k$ for all $k$ overlap,
supporting the conclusion that the values of $b_k$ are not
statistically different. In light of this, we reject these two
power-law kernel variable $b$ models. 

Out of the remaining eight candidate models (four with the Gaussian
kernel; four with the power-law kernel) we compare the WAIC
(Table~\ref{table:WAIC}). According to the WAIC the power law kernel
outperforms the Gaussian kernel - even the most flexible Gaussian
model (variable $\psi$ and $\gamma$) results in a WAIC that is higher
than the least flexible power law kernel model (base model). The power
law kernel model with variable $a$ and $\gamma$ results in the lowest
WAIC, indicating that it performs the best out of the suite of
considered models. Depite the WAIC relative model rankings, assessing
the effect the kernel formulations have on pollen production estimates
and predictions is still of value. PVM results will be used to make
vegetation composition predictions back through time, and these
predictions are determined (in part) by the dispersal kernel.

In light of this, we continue to compare the two base models (Gaussian
and power law), as well as the models with the lowest WAIC for each
kernel type - the Gaussian variable $\psi$ and $\gamma$ model and the
power law variable $a$ and $\gamma$ model (hereafter referred to as
the Gaussian or power law variable models).

In Figure~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}, the raw pollen proportions are
plotted against the vegetation proportions for each grid cell (red
crosses). The relationship between the pollen and vegetation is
clearly not 1:1. In particular, we see that some taxa, such as beech,
maple, other conifer, and tamarack, are not prolific pollen producers
- they can appear in large proportions on the landscape, but never
appear in large proportion in the pollen record. Some relationships
are difficult to identify, for example pine, where it varies from
sparse to abundant on the local landscape, but this relative
composition provides little indication about the relative abundance of
pine pollen.

These relationships are complicated in part because of differential
pollen production, which the calibration modelaccounts for by the
taxon-specific scaling parameter $\phi_k$. After scaling the local
vegetation in a cell by $\phi_k$, we can again compare the raw pollen
proportions with these pollen predictions
(Figure~\ref{fig:focal_scaled}; black and blue dots). Here we show
predictions only the variable gaussian and power law models, but note
that the results are similar for the base models. Scaling by $\phi$
does improve our pollen estimates; for many taxa, the black points
have shifted towards the 1:1 line. This is especially true for maple,
tamarack, and other conifer, suggesting that these pollen-vegetation
relationships are heavily influenced by local pollen sources. However,
for most of the remaining taxa the improvement is minimal, indicating
that simply scaling the local vegetation proportions is not sufficient
to predict deposited pollen.

In Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, we again plot the raw pollen proportions
against both the vegetation (red crosses) and predicted pollen for the
variable models (Gaussian: black dots; power law: blue dots), but in
this case the predicted pollen is based on the local plus non-local
predictions obtained from the full calibration model. Now that
non-local dispersal has been accounted for, the raw versus predicted
pollen points fall more closely along the 1:1 line. This indicates
that in our domain non-local dispersal processes account for much of
the pollen that arrive at any given location. For most taxa, the
improvement that we gain by using more flexible models versus the base
models is not qualitatively obvious. However, for Hemlock, there is an
obvious improvement in our ability to predict sediment pollen with the
more flexible models. Both base models underpredict Hemlock pollen at
sites where there is relatively high proportion of Hemlock (although
Hemlock pollen never exceeds 28\% at any site in our domain), but this
is not the case for the variable Gaussian and Power Law models. This
suggests that the relative contribution of local versus non-local
hemlock pollen is estimated to be less than the true value,
i.e. $\gamma$ is too small.

From each model we obtain taxon-specific estimates for the ratio of
local to non-local pollen $\phi$ (Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). If these
parameter estimates truly represent differential pollen
production/dispersal, then these estimated values should be consistent
across model variants, which is generally the case
(Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). However, for several taxa including beech,
Hemlock and Pine the variable power law kernel models predicts much
larger $\phi$ values than the other models. However, in some of these
cases the credible intervals are large, and overlap with competing
estimates of $\phi$, suggesting that these estimates may not be
statistically different. Aside from the few uncertain values resulting
from the variable power law model, the estimated values of $\phi$ form
three distinct groups in $\phi$ parameter space: low, intermediate,
and high production/dispersal (Figure~\ref{fig:phi}). The group of
taxa with lowest production/dispersal in decreasing order are beech,
maple, other conifer, and tamarack. This low production/dispersal
pattern is evident in Figure~\ref{fig:preds}, where the representation
of these taxa in the pollen records is consistently less than their
representation on the landscape (except at a few anomalous
ponds). Intermediate producers/dispersers, again in decreasing order,
include other hardwood, oak, elm, hemlock, ash, and spruce. The high
production/dispersal group includes pine and birch, which can also be
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:preds} by their propensity to be
over-represented in the pollen record relative to the landscape. These
results agree in general with \citep{prentice1986}, which analyzed the
pollen-vegetation relationship for sites in Wisconsin and the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan. In that work, pine and birch had the largest
slopes (top producers/dispersers), and maple and tamarack as limited
producers/dispersers. \citep{jackson1990} also found that Pine and
Birch were good dispersers with effective source areas of 1000m, while
Maple was found to have a much smaller source area indicating limited
dispersal.

For the base models, the local versus non-local weight parameter
$\gamma$ was estimated to have a mean of $0.21$ for the Gaussian
kernel model and $0.07$ for the power law kernel model. These values
indicate that 21\% (or 7\%) of the pollen produced by vegetation in a
focal grid cell is deposited in that grid cell, while the remaining
79\% (or 93\%) disperses elsewhere in the domain.

When we allowed $\gamma$ to vary by taxon in the variable models, the
estimates for both kernels yielded similar results with overlapping 95
\% credible intervals for all taxa except Pine and Oak
(Table~\ref{table:gamma}). Birch, Other conifer, Ash, and Other
hardwood all had lower estimates of $\gamma$, with mean posterior
values all less than 0.12 (mean values ranging from 0.03 -
0.11). Those taxa with larger estimated values of $\gamma$ were
Hemlock, Tamarack, Maple, Beech, Spruce, and Elm. For both Pine and
Oak, the variable Gaussian kernel models estimated higher values of
$\gamma$. It is encouraging that these estimates of localness are
similar for both variable case models, but based on these estimates
alone we can compare only focal-cell contributions. Non-local
dispersal is determined by the product of $(1-\gamma)$ with the sum of
the weights of all non-local cells, which in turn depends on the
estimated kernel parameter(s).

For the base Gaussian kernel case, the spread parameter $\psi$ was
estimated to be $204\,(192, 215)$ km. In the variable Gaussian model
$\psi$ estimates ranged from 152 for Pine to 361 for Other hardwood
(Figure~\ref{fig:XXX}). For many taxa, 95\% credible intervals are large;
this is especially true for Tamarack, with a credible interval of
(128, 553). For the base power law model, the kernel parameters $a$
and $b$ were estimated to be $0.01\,(8.29e-3, 0.01)$ and $2.03\,(2.00,
2.12)$. For the variable power law model case, the estimated $b$ value
was almost identical to the base model $2.06\,(2.00, 2.16)$. The $a$
estimates ranged from $2.68e-3$ for Beech to $0.203$ for Elm.

The most intuitive way to assess how these parameters affect pollen
dispersal is to plot the proportion of deposited pollen as a function
of radius from the pollen source. So, we plot $\gamma + (1- \gamma)
\sum_{s_j \neq s_i} w(s(i), s_j)$ for a hypothetical core ($i$)
centered on our potential discretized domain, where for a defined
radius, cells are included in the non-local sum if the distance
between $s(i)$ and $s_j$ is less than or equal to this radius. Then,
for each taxon, we can plot cumulative density functions of the
deposited pollen for each of the four considered models
(Figure~\ref{fig:XXX}). We note that the plotted based model functions
are identical for all taxa (solid lines).  For the variable models, we
can see the effects of changes in magnitude in both $\psi$ for the
Gaussian kernel, and $a$ for the variable kernel. The CDFs for the
Gaussian kernel models all have a sigmoidal shape, where smaller
values of $\psi$ correspond to a steeper slope indicating that
relatively more pollen deposition happens close to the source. The
contrast between the two most extreme $\psi$ values is seen the Pine
(lowest) and Other hardwood (highest) variable Gaussian CDFs. For the
variable power law model, for fixed $b$, larger values of $a$ result
in a more sigmoidal shape that resembles the Gaussian kernel, for
example as seen with Elm where the variable model CDFs are nearly
identical. Again for fixed $b$, smaller values of $a$ results in a
concave downward curve that shows that pollen is deposited closer to
the source, but at a certain distance from the source - where the
Gaussian and power law CDFs intersect - the cumulative pollen
deposition is equal. To help interpret these curves, we determined the
radius from the source needed to capture 50\% and 90\% of the
deposited pollen for each model and each taxon
(Table~\ref{table:pollen_acc}). As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cdf}, the
CDFs for the two base models have two points of intersection,
indicating changing relative rates of accumulation. The power law
based model estimates a smaller radius needed to accumulate 50\% of
the pollen, however, the Gaussian base model cdf asymptotes to one
more quickly (shorter-tailed kernel). For the variable models, the
taxon with the smallest radius from a pollen source needed to
accumulate 50\% of the dispersed pollen was Hemlock (60 km for the
variable Gaussian, and 28 km for the the variable power law), while
Other hardwood required the largest radius to accumulate the same
percent (264 km for the variable Gaussian, 252 km for the variable
power law). To capture 90\% of the dispersed pollen required radii of
216 km for Pine up to 448 km for Other hardwood for the variable
Gaussian model, and 292 km for Hemlock to 476 km for Elm and Other
hardwood for the variable power law model.

% To assess the assumption that all taxa share a dispersal kernel with
% spread controlled by the scalar $\psi$, we re-ran the model letting
% $\psi$ vary by taxon. Five of the taxon-specific 95\% credible
% intervals had some overlap with the credible intervals for the
% single-$\psi$ case, while the remaining taxa had estimated $\psi$
% value that were larger (Figure~\ref{fig:psi_vary_psi}). Elm, Tamarack,
% Maple, and Ash had the largest mean value of $\psi$, although the
% uncertainty of these estimates was large - for example, for Tamarack
% the mean value and credible interval of $\psi$ was $0.73 (0.10,
% 1.9)$. When we let $\psi$ vary by taxon, there was little effect on
% the values of $\phi$. The ordering of the taxa remained identical,
% except for a minor switch in position of Oak with Elm
% (Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). XXX: I don't get the dispersal pars
% for elm, tam, maple, ash - why are these so big?

% On average, Maple had by far the
% largest value of $\psi$, followed by Other hardwood, which implies
% that these two taxonomic groups are disperse the farthest. However,
% the 95\% credible interval for $\psi$ for Maple was wide, and in both
% cases the increased value of $\psi$ corresponded with an increased
% value of $\phi$ relative to the single-$\psi$ runs
% (Figure~\ref{fig:phi_vary_psi}). This indicates that there may be
% some issues with parameter identifiability inherent in the model when
% we allow $\psi$ to vary by taxon, and as such results from this run
% should be interepreted with caution.


To visualize the dispersal patterns predicted by our model, we can
estimate the proportion of deposited pollen by taxon for each grid
cell in the domain (previously we were estimating deposited pollen
only at lakes for which we had pollen data)
(Figures~\ref{fig:maps_pollen} \& \ref{fig:maps_pollen_pl}). These
spatial maps help us understand how the models treat
dispersal. Comparing these two figures illustrates the differences
between these two models - the predicted sediment pollen maps for the
variable power law model are much smoother. This is due to the
increased accumulation of dispersed pollen at short distances relative
to the Gaussian, which predicts that the fastest accumulation rate of
dispersed pollen occurs farther from the source (see
Figure~\ref{fig:cdf}).


We can also compare the predicted pollen maps with those depicting the
relative tree abundance (Figure~\ref{fig:maps_veg}), remembering that
the pollen predictions have been scaled to account for differential
production (so we are comparing predicted sediment pollen with
vegetation composition). This scaling for differential production is
particularly apparent for Tamarack. We know from the data that
Tamarack pollen proportions are always lower than the vegetation
proportions, and as a result, we expect that the model will predict
low amounts of Tamarack pollen, which it does. To see how the model
predicts dispersal by taxon, based on parameters estimated from that
data, we can compare the vegetation and pollen ranges. The effects of
dispersal are especially clear in the Pine and Oak cases, where we see
pollen dispersing well beyond the range limits of the vegetation range
boundaries.
