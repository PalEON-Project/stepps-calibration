<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Understanding forest ecosystems of the past provides valuable information about how these
ecosystems respond to biotic and abiotic factors at timescales outside the realm of most direct
ecological observations. In particular, in a world of changing climates, reconstructing past shifts in
tree distributions and forest composition provides new information about climatic processes
governing forest distributions and dynamics [<a 
href="#Xgoring2015a">Goring et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgoring2015a">in prep.</a>], and vegetation-atmosphere
feedbacks [<a 
href="#Xmatthes2015">Matthes et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmatthes2015">in review.</a>]. The fossil pollen records extracted from lakes and mires are
our primary source of data about prehistoric forest composition. Rigorous estimates of past forest
composition and forest dynamics from these records relies on our ability to quantify the
pollen-vegetation relationship.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   Key challenges to quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation from pollen data are 1) the
complex nature of the pollen-vegetation relationship and 2) the heavy anthropogenic
imprint on contemporary plant communities. The processes governing pollen production,
transport, and deposition have been the subject of palynological study for decades

href="#Xprentice1988records">Prentice</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xprentice1988records">1988</a>]. The
pollen found in lakes and mires usually arrives by wind, from plants that vary in their pollen
productivity, the dispersibility of pollen grains, and transport vector. As a result, some plant
species are highly overrepresented in sedimentary archives and most are underrepresented or
absent. A wide variety of pollen-vegetation models (PVMs) have been developed including
modern-analog based approaches [<a 
href="#Xwilliams2003variations">Williams</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwilliams2003variations">2003</a>], linear-regression [<a

href="#Xprentice1988records">Prentice</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xprentice1988records">1988</a>], and, most recently,
Bayesian hierarchical models [<a 
href="#Xpaciorek2009mapping">Paciorek and McLachlan</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpaciorek2009mapping">2009</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgarreta2010method">Garreta et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgarreta2010method">2010</a>]. In these
Bayesian models, pollen counts from a network of ponds are modelled as a function of gridded
forest composition data, taking into account pollen dispersal from both local and non-local
vegetation, differential pollen production, and process uncertainty. Using a Bayesian
hierarchical model allows borrowing of information across space to estimate governing
                                                                                         <img

parameters at a regional scale, and to estimate the uncertainty associated with these
parameters.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   Some PVMs, notably the LOVE/REVEALS family of models [<a 
href="#Xsugita2007theory1">Sugita</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsugita2007theory1">2007a</a>,<a 
href="#Xsugita2007theory2">b</a>], are calibrated
using information about pollen productivity and dispersal traits for individual species and
diffusion-based models of particulate transport. Other PVMs are calibrated against spatial
networks of pollen assemblages extracted from surface sediment samples, which are then
cross-referenced to contemporary spatial datasets of vegetation composition and abundance of the
surrounding forests. These cross-referenced pollen and vegetation datasets are then use
to make inferences about the processes that affect pollen production, dispersal, and
deposition at the time of sampling. However, extending any inference about these processes
to times prior to the time of sampling requires the assumption that pollen-vegetation
relationships are stationary. This assumption of stationarity is questionable given that the
contemporary landscape has been heavily modified by human land use. This land-use has
transformed the composition and structure of contemporary forests and likely altered
vegetation-pollen relationships for some taxa [<a 
href="#Xkujawa2015">Kujawa et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xkujawa2015">in prep.</a>], perhaps by altering
microclimatic factors including wind dynamics. Pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions in
Minnesota have a demonstrated bias if modern calibration datasets are used instead of
pre-settlement datasets [<a 
href="#Xst2014bias">St&#x00A0;Jacques et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xst2014bias">2014</a>]. Hence, any PVM that is calibrated using
contemporary datasets may carry implicit and difficult-to-quantify biases when applied
to make inferences about vegetation composition for time periods with less intensive
land use. To circumvent these issues, we calibrate the pollen-vegetation relationship
using newly developed datasets of forest composition and sediment pollen data that
pre-dates European settlement, thereby avoiding the effects of settlement, agriculture, and
industrialization.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   These datasets are based on US Public Land Survey (PLS) records collected by surveyors prior
to European settlement [<a

href="#Xschulte2001original">Schulte and Mladenoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xschulte2001original">2001</a>].
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   To calibrate the pollen-vegetation relationship against the PLS forest composition data requires
that we identify pollen samples that correspond to the pre-settlement era. These fossil pollen
samples are drawn from longer sequences that typically come from lakes or peatlands, and consist
of a series of depths and associated pollen counts broken down by taxon. Most pollen
records also have radiocarbon dates of organic materials scattered along the core at
locations not necessarily aligned with pollen counts. Other age controls include other
radiometric dates (e.g. 210Pb), biostratigraphic markers (e.g. the rise in Ambrosia and other
weedy taxa during EuroAmerican settlement), and geostratigraphic markers such as the
core top whose age typically corresponds with the year of sampling. These age controls
are then used to constrain age-depth models that allow inference of age at any depth
throughout the core. However, inferred ages are uncertain, due to analytical errors during
the laboratory radiocarbon dating process [<a

href="#Xblois2011methodological">Blois et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xblois2011methodological">2011</a>]. As in ecology, Bayesian
hierarchical modeling approaches to age-depth models are rapidly gaining popularity for their
ability to accommodate irregular probability distribution functions, multiple sources of
uncertainty, and prior information [<a

change in relative composition of <span

class="cmti-12">Ambrosia rise</span>, can be used to
identify the pollen sample that best corresponds with pre-settlement - the pre-settlement pollen
sample is the sample immediately prior to the first pollen sample that reflects the <span 
class="cmti-12">Ambrosia rise</span>.
The presence of an established biostratigraphic marker at the time of settlement eliminates the
need to rely on uncertain age-depth models. However, time series of pollen counts are
noisy, and in practice it can be difficult to precisely identify the settlement horizon. We
deal with the uncertainty associated with <span

elicitation.

building of a pre-settlement era identification of pre-settlement pollen samples from pollen
time series through expert elicitation and the testing and comparison of two standard
isometric dispersal kernels. We apply modelling results to develop new estimates of relative
pollen productivity and source area, assess the relative importance of local and non-local
pollen sources, and compare these results to prior estimates of source area and pollen
productivity. This work lays the methodological foundation for rigorous reconstruction of past
forest composition from fossil pollen data and all scripts are made publicly available at

<!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >Prior to major European settlement, the US General Land Office conducted a Public Land Survey
(PLS) throughout much of the United States to simplify the sale of federal lands. Surveyors
documented section locations using trees as landmarks, and recorded genus or species, diameter,
and location (azimuth and distance from corner). This data set provides a systematic survey of the
forest before settlement, and has been used by foresters, ecologists, and historians to understand
ecosystem and land-use change through time. In the Upper Midwest, the survey was conducted
                                                                                         <img

during XXXX-XXXX. Due to the slow-growing nature of temperate forests, including those in the
Upper Midwest, we can think of the PLS data as a snapshot of forest composition in
time.
<!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >   Survey data for the Upper Midwest has been recently digitized, and aggregated to an 8km
square grid [<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]. As a result of the sampling methodology, this aggregation results in small numbers
of tree counts per grid cell. To overcome the variability arising from this we work with
a smoothed version of the PLS data, based on a Bayesian spatial multinomial model
[<span

taxa as well as less-abundant taxa of particular ecological importance. Our modelled taxa are: ash,
beech, birch, elm, hemlock, maple, oak, pine, spruce, larch, as well as other conifer and other
hardwood groups. These latter two groups include other minor tree species identified by surveyors
but not explicitly included in the aforementioned list of taxa. The separation of other hardwood

although the variability in production and dispersal within each of these groups is still
large.

<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" >With the push for robust and reproducible research from the scientific community,
paleoecoinformatics has responded with the development of tools that make it possible to
access and query large datasets. One such tool that has made this work possible is the
Neotoma database (<a 
href="neotomadb.org" class="url" ><span 
class="cmtt-12">neotomadb.org</span></a>; [<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]), which stores a variety of types of paleoecological
data, including pollen data. Accessing this data can be done using the Neotoma API
(<a 
href="http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/" class="url" ><span 
class="cmtt-12">http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/</span></a>), or using the R neotoma package [<a 
href="#Xgoring2015">Goring
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgoring2015">2015</a>]. Using R neotoma we identifed 184 sediment pollen cores in the Neotoma database in
our spatial domain with the restriction that these sediment cores include at least some
pollen samples believed to be from the last 2000 years. All of these pollen cores were
sampled at multiple depths, often regularly spaced, and are hereafter referred to as long
cores.
<!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >   An additional 57 cores not available on Neotoma were contributed by independent researchers
[<a 
href="#Xkujawa2015">Kujawa et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xkujawa2015">in prep.</a>]. Of these 57, 9 were long cores (analogous to those from neotoma), while
the remaining 48 had only core top and pre-settlement samples (at least in the data file we had
access to), and are therefore referred to as short cores.
<!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >   Associated with each of the cores is a table containing counts by taxon for each sampled depth.
These counts are not certain - classifying pollen grains based on morphological features and
                                                                                         <img

relating them to plant taxa is often challenging as a result of (differential) preservation. Counts
between palynologists for a single sample will also differ, but for experts this difference should be
negligible [<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>].
<!--l. 263--><p class="indent" >   One of the challenges that arises when working with pollen data collected by several (or more)
individuals is dealing with naming inconsistencies in the pollen taxonomies between sites. Both
differing nomenclature and identified taxonomic resolution require that care be taken when
standardizing pollen taxonomies. There arise cases where it may not be possible to associate
certain pollen grains with plant taxa, and in these cases grains may be identified to type (e.g.
Alnus-type), or placed into a group whose name is defined by their morphology (e.g. tricolporate).
In this study, decisions regarding these poorly identified pollen grains were made on a case-by-case
basis, although the total number of grains that fell into these ambiguous classes were
few.
<!--l. 276--><p class="indent" >   For each pollen core we are interested in the pre-settlement sample that is closest in time to the
PLS data collection date (which is spatially varying). Typically, age-depth models are used to
assign ages to sample depths to sediment cores. However, age-depth modelling is an uncertain
process, with no consensus in the paleoecological community on a single best model or method.
Instead, we rely on a panel of experts to interpret patterns in the pollen count data in order
to identify pre-settlement sample estimates. All 185 long cores were suitable for this
exercise.

elicitation</h4>
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >Widespread land clearance during European settlement provided habitat for many non-arboreal
colonizers, resulting in increases in non-arboreal taxa in pollen time series [<a 
href="#Xmcandrews1988human">McAndrews</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmcandrews1988human">1988</a>]. In
the Upper Midwest, significant increases in ragweed (<span 
class="cmti-12">Ambrosia</span>), docks and sorrels (<span 
class="cmti-12">Rumex</span>), and
grasses (<span 
class="cmti-12">Poaceae</span>) are typically coincident with this settlement horizon. In principle, it is possible
to identify the pre-settlement sample - the sample that falls immediately before these increases in
agricultural indicator species. For many records the rises are sharp and determining the
pre-settlement sample is easy, while other records are more ambiguous and placement relies on
subjective judgment.
<!--l. 299--><p class="indent" >   For this study, in the interest of reducing uncertainty, we want to: 1) identify pre-settlement
samples using consistent methodology, and 2) assess the variability in assignment of pre-settlement
among analysts. To address these questions, we asked a team of expert palynologists to identify
the pre-settlement sample for 185 pollen records. Experts were provided with pollen
diagrams depicting proportional changes through time as a function of depth for key
indicator species and the ten most abundant arboreal taxa. Experts were prohibited
from relying on stratigraphic dates (radiocarbon or other) or age-depth model estimates
of sample age. In the case that there was no distinguishable pre-settlement sample,
experts were instructed to report NA. In the case that experts were uncertain about their
pre-settlement sample assignment, they were instructed to note this, with or without
justification. Results from this exercise are used to define depths associated with pre-settlement
samples. Pollen samples associated with these depths are placed into our calibration data

composition and abundance of trees on the landscape determines (in part) the composition and
abundance of pollen that is deposited in the sediment. Determining how much pollen the
surrounding vegetation contributes is a complex function of forest characteristics, climate
(including wind), grain size and morphology, topography, and proximity of the vegetation to a
deposition basin.
<!--l. 332--><p class="indent" >   We work on a grid defined by the resolution of the gridded PLS data, and define each
deposition site as having both local and non-local pollen contributions. Local contributions are
made by the vegetation within the same grid cell as a site, and non-local contribution are
made by vegetation from all other grid cells in the domain. The relative contributions of
the local and non-local contributions are determined by a model parameter, with the
restriction that the sum of all contributions from the pollen source area must sum to
one.
<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   Contributions from non-local grid cells are not all equal - their relative contributions are
weighted using a dispersal kernel, which determines how likely it is for pollen to travel from one
grid cell to another. Dispersal kernels are typically isometric, meaning that they depend only
on the distance of the tree to the pond, and not the absolute position or direction. In
reality, dispersal is not isometric, predominantly due to prevailing wind direction, but
also as a result of other asymmetries in surface roughness and landscape structure.
However, isometric dispersal kernels are are a reasonable and widely used approximation,
because turbulent atmospheric mixing below the boundary layer tends to smooth out
anisotropies.
<!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   Here we test two dispersal kernels: the Gaussian and the Inverse power-law. The Gaussian
kernel is often used as a reference against more leptokurtic kernels such as the Inverse power law
kernel, and can represent dispersal through diffusion. Although the Gaussian kernel has simpler
mathematical representation, fatter-tailed kernels (such as the Inverse power-law) in
general perform better than those with thinner tails (like the Gaussian or Exponential)
when modelling pollen dispersal [<a

dispersal data needed to validate pollen dispersal models are generally unavailable,
especially at the large spatial scales needed to adequately test long-tailed kernels [<a

The precision parameter <span

class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> is also affected by the proximity of a lake to the domain boundary. We
do not have data outside of the defined domain, so cannot quantify the pollen dispersed from
vegetation outside the domain to lakes situated close to the boundary. The repercussion of this is
that the sum of the weights of the grid cells contributing pollen to a focal cell close to the domain
boundary is less than the sum of the weights of the total potential contributing neighborhood,
defined as C. As a result of having a reduced contributing neighborhood, the local pollen

suitability</h4>
<!--l. 605--><p class="noindent" >Four experts participated in the elicitation exercise. For 59 out of 185 sites, the experts were in
total agreement: they all identified the same pre-settlement sample (53 cases) or agreed that no
such sample could be identified (6 cases). The remaining sites varied in level of disagreement - in
79 cases, experts identified two samples; in 39 cases 3 pre-settlement samples were identified; and
in 8 cases there was no agreement. These results confirm our hypothesis that identification of
biostratigraphic markers is subject to variability between analysts and is the first to quantify this
uncertainty.
<!--l. 615--><p class="indent" >   Of the 6 sites that experts agreed had no discernible settlement signal, two of these sites were
at Rice Lake, which is an anomalous site overwhelmed by a wild rice (<span 
class="cmti-12">Zizania</span>) and grass (<span 
class="cmti-12">Poaceae</span>)
signal, and does not show any indication of settlement. The remaining four included:
Rossburg peat bog in Minnesota; Disterhaft Farm Bog in Wisconsin; Kirchner Marsh in
Minnesota; and Stewarts Dark Lake in Wisconsin. Three of these four sites are bogs and
marshes with local marshland non-arboreal plants growing at or near the coring location;
these marshland plants may be swamping the signal from agricultural non-arboreal
indicators.
<!--l. 626--><p class="indent" >   Based on these results, we were subsequently faced with the challenge of establishing site
suitability criteria to determine which sites to include in the calibration data set. Ideally, the now
quantified pre-settlement sample uncertainty would be included into the modelling framework, but
this option was rejected for now in favor of simplicity of the statistical model. Instead,
we set rules for filtering suitable sites and assigning pre-settlement depths on expert
determinations.

quantified pre-settlement sample uncertainty would be included into the modelling framework.
Although this is surely possible, it would increase the complexity of the statistical model. For the
sake of simplicity, we filter suitable sites and assign pre-settlement depths in a systematic way
based on expert determinations.
<!--l. 650--><p class="indent" >   Sites were considered unsuitable if: 1) a majority chose not to assign a pre-settlement sample
(12 sites), or 2) if half of the experts chose not to assign a pre-settlement sample and the remaining
half identified pre-settlement samples whose modelled ages were far from the approximate time of
settlement (7 sites). For this second criterion, we looked to existing age-depth models
associated with the pollen cores. Modelled ages for the identified pre-settlement depths were
compared to 1850 AD, which serves as an approximate year of settlement in the upper
Midwest. Modeled ages were defined to be far from the expert-identified settlement
horizon if discrepancies were 500 years All 19 unsuitable sites were excluded from further
analysis.
<!--l. 663--><p class="indent" >   After completion of the elicitation exercise, a follow-up examination of the stratigraphic data
revealed several cores with core tops with dates much older than expected - typically the date of a
true core top corresponds with the year of sampling (with some margin of error). Further
investigation uncovered that three of the cores included in our analysis were missing core tops. For
both Lake Mary and Green Lake, we determined that the core tops pre-date settlement, and these
sites were therefore were discarded [<a

had a core top corresponding to the pre-settlement sample, and this sample was retained for
inclusion in the calibration data set [<a 
href="#Xwright1969">Wright et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwright1969">1969</a>]. Interestingly, for each of these
cores, 1-3 experts identified a pre-settlement sample (although to be fair, they made
this judgment based solely on the stratigraphic diagram and no information about site
characteristics, and likely assumed that the uppermost sample was in fact a surface
sample).
<!--l. 680--><p class="indent" >   After the suitability screening, we were left with 165 long cores. For many cores,
there was no consensus, which left us to determine how to assign our best estimate of
pre-settlement. Given the sample resolution and an even number of experts, neither the mean
nor the median were options. Keeping in mind that we would rather err on the side
of caution and choose a depth that was more certainly pre-settlement (deeper) than
one that represented post-disturbance times (more shallow), we ordered the sample
depths from deepest to shallowest, and selected the second in this list (typically the
second deepest, although sometimes the two largest sample depths were equal). The
additional 48 short cores from the Calcote dataset were not candidates for the elicitation
exercise because they had only a core top and a pre-settlement sample recorded. The
decision to include this additional data in the calibration data set was debated - the
pre-settlement samples for these cores were identified using different methodology (and
analysts) than the remaining sites. In the end, we opted to include these samples as part of
the calibration data set, based on our confidence in the data set and analysts and the
recognition that including these sites would result in a substantive increase in sample size. In
total we had 213 pollen samples in the Upper Midwest settlement-era calibration data
set.

<!--l. 704--><p class="noindent" >To visually assess the relationship between sediment pollen and tree taxa, we compare pie maps
which depict the relative proportions of taxa across space (Figure&#x00A0;<a

patterns are consistent with each other, with both pollen and PLS data capturing the major
ecotones in the region [<a 
href="#Xsolomon1985computer">Solomon and Webb</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsolomon1985computer">1985</a>]. However, there are some striking
differences. First, pine dominates the pollen records for most of the northern half of the
domain. Second, in the vegetation composition data, some regions that have higher
relative abundances of Hemlock, Tamarack, and Maple are not apparent or much less
pronounced in the pollen data. These taxa are known to be underrepresented in the
pollen record [<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span>]. As expected, these pictures confirm that pollen is able to capture
key vegetational gradients, but that the relationship between pollen and vegetation is
complex.
<!--l. 719--><p class="indent" >   To further assess spatial distributions of pollen versus PLS data, we plot the data as heat maps
by taxon. Differences in extent of these distributions indicate pollen dispersal beyond species range
limits. For example, for both birch and pine, both of which are known to be overrepresented in
pollen records, the distributions of sediment pollen extend well beyond the boundaries of those
shown in the PLS data (Figures&#x00A0;<a

used in further analysis. For a total of 30,000 iterations per model, the effective sample

<!--l. 744--><p class="indent" >   To compare among models, we first assess the estimates of the hyperparameters for the
exchangeable priors. All parameter and hyperparameter estimates support the use of taxon-specific
parameter values, except for the power-law models which allow <span

the estimated variance for the exchangeable prior for log(<span

<!--l. 756--><p class="indent" >   Out of the remaining eight candidate models (four with the Gaussian kernel; four with the
power-law kernel) we compare the WAIC (Table&#x00A0;<a

(variable <span

class="cmmi-12">&#x03B3;</span>) results in a WAIC that is higher than the least flexible power law
kernel model (base model). The power law kernel model with variable <span 
class="cmmi-12">a </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03B3; </span>results in
the lowest WAIC, indicating that it performs the best out of the suite of considered
models. However, it is still of interest to make further comparisons between the two
kernels - does the kernel formulation make a noticeable different in pollen production
estimates and pollen predictions? One of the goals of this work is to use the calibrated
pollen-vegetation relationship to estimate vegetation composition back through time,
and therefore it is natural to think about how kernel selection affects predictions, if at
all.
<!--l. 772--><p class="indent" >   In light of this, we continue to compare the two base models (Gaussian and power law), as well

particular, we see that some taxa, such as beech, maple, other conifer, and tamarack, are not
prolific pollen producers - they can appear in large proportions on the landscape, but never appear
in large proportion in the pollen record. Some relationships are difficult to identify, for
example pine, where it varies from sparse to abundant on the local landscape, but this
relative composition provides little indication about the relative abundance of pine

vegetation in a cell by <span

predictions (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180085">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:focal_scaled --></a>; black and blue dots). Here we show predictions only the variable gaussian
and power law models, but note that the results are similar for the base models. Scaling by <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03D5; </span>does
improve our pollen estimates; for many taxa, the black points have shifted towards
the 1:1 line. This is especially true for maple, tamarack, and other conifer, suggesting
that these pollen-vegetation relationships are heavily influenced by local pollen sources.
However, for most of the remaining taxa the improvement is minimal, indicating that
simply scaling the local vegetation proportions is not sufficient to predict deposited
pollen.

but in this case the predicted pollen is based on the local plus non-local predictions
obtained from the full calibration model. Now that non-local dispersal has been accounted
for, the raw versus predicted pollen points fall more closely along the 1:1 line. This
indicates that in our domain non-local dispersal processes account for much of the pollen
that arrive at any given location. For most taxa, the improvement that we gain by
using more flexible models versus the base models is not qualitatively obvious. This is
not true for Hemlock - both base models underpredict Hemlock pollen at sites where
there is relatively high proportion of Hemlock (although Hemlock pollen never exceeds
28% at any site in our domain). This suggests that the relative contribution of local
versus non-local hemlock pollen is estimated to be less than the true value, i.e. <span

<!--l. 841--><p class="indent" >   There are two anomalous sites for which the model is unable to adequately account for the
processes leading to the (relatively speaking) unusual compositional makeup of the deposited
pollen. The first is Ocheda Lake, a large but shallow glacial kettle lake in Southwestern
Minnesota. The pollen diagrams indicate a relative spike in deposited Maple pollen in the
pre-settlement sample. The second is Tamarack Creek, a site situated in a wetland with high
Tamarack pollen counts for the top 80 cm of sediment. At this site, the calibration sample is
composed of 40 % Tamarack, while all other fossil pollen sites contain a maximum of 1 %
Tamarack.

(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180107">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:phi --></a>). If these parameter estimates truly represent differential pollen production/dispersal,
then these estimated values should be consistent across model variants, which is generally the case
(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180107">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:phi --></a>). However, for several taxa including beech, Hemlock and Pine the variable power law
kernel models predicts much larger <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03D5; </span>values than the other models. However, in some of these cases
the credible intervals are large, and overlap with competing estimates of <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03D5;</span>, suggesting
that these estimates may not be statistically different. Aside from the few uncertain
values resulting from the variable power law model, the estimated values of <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03D5; </span>form three
distinct groups in <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03D5; </span>parameter space: low, intermediate, and high production/dispersal
(Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180107">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:phi --></a>). The group of taxa with lowest production/dispersal in decreasing order are beech,
maple, other conifer, and tamarack. This low production/dispersal pattern is evident in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180096">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:preds --></a>, where the representation of these taxa in the pollen records is consistently
less than their representation on the landscape (except at a few anomalous ponds).
Intermediate producers/dispersers, again in decreasing order, include other hardwood, oak, elm,
hemlock, ash, and spruce. The high production/dispersal group includes pine and birch,
which can also be seen in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180096">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:preds --></a> by their propensity to be over-represented in the
pollen record relative to the landscape. These results agree in general with [<a

Webb</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xprentice1986">1986</a>], which analyzed the pollen-vegetation relationship for sites in Wisconsin and
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In that work, pine and birch had the largest slopes
(top producers/dispersers), and maple and tamarack as limited producers/dispersers.
[<a

1000m, while Maple was found to have a much smaller source area indicating limited
dispersal.

indicate that 21% (or 7%) of the pollen produced by vegetation in a focal grid cell is
deposited in that grid cell, while the remaining 79% (or 93%) disperses elsewhere in the

Those taxa with larger estimated values of <span

higher values of <span

variable case models, but based on these estimates alone we can compare only focal-cell
contributions. Non-local dispersal is determined by the product of (1 <span

<!--l. 919--><p class="indent" >   The most intuitive way to assess how these parameters affect pollen dispersal is to plot the

class="cmmi-12">i</span>)<span 
class="cmmi-12">,s</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span></sub>) for a hypothetical core (<span 
class="cmmi-12">i</span>) centered on our potential discretized
domain, where for a defined radius, cells are included in the non-local sum if the distance
between <span 
class="cmmi-12">s</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">i</span>) and <span 
class="cmmi-12">s</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span></sub> is less than or equal to this radius. Then, for each taxon, we can plot
cumulative density functions of the deposited pollen for each of the four considered models
(Figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-12">??</span>). We note that the plotted based model functions are identical for all taxa (solid
lines). For the variable models, we can see the effects of changes in magnitude in both
<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03C8; </span>for the Gaussian kernel, and <span 
class="cmmi-12">a </span>for the variable kernel. The CDFs for the Gaussian
kernel models all have a sigmoidal shape, where smaller values of <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03C8; </span>correspond to a
steeper slope indicating that relatively more pollen deposition happens close to the
source. The contrast between the two most extreme <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03C8; </span>values is seen the Pine (lowest)
and Other hardwood (highest) variable Gaussian CDFs. For the variable power law
model, for fixed <span 
class="cmmi-12">b</span>, larger values of <span 
class="cmmi-12">a </span>result in a more sigmoidal shape that resembles the
Gaussian kernel, for example as seen with Elm where the variable model CDFs are nearly
identical. Again for fixed <span 
class="cmmi-12">b</span>, smaller values of <span 
class="cmmi-12">a </span>results in a concave downward curve that
shows that pollen is deposited closer to the source, but at a certain distance from the
source - where the Gaussian and power law CDFs intersect - the cumulative pollen
deposition is equal. To help interpret these curves, we determined the radius from the source
needed to capture 50% and 90% of the deposited pollen for each model and each taxon
(Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:pollen_acc --></a>). As seen in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180118">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cdf --></a>, the CDFs for the two base models have two points of
intersection, indicating changing relative rates of accumulation. The power law based model
estimates a smaller radius needed to accumulate 50% of the pollen, however, the Gaussian
base model cdf asymptotes to one more quickly (shorter-tailed kernel). For the variable
models, the taxon with the smallest radius from a pollen source needed to accumulate
50% of the dispersed pollen was Hemlock (60 km for the variable Gaussian, and 28
km for the the variable power law), while Other hardwood required the largest radius
to accumulate the same percent (264 km for the variable Gaussian, 252 km for the
variable power law). To capture 90% of the dispersed pollen required radii of 216 km
for Pine up to 448 km for Other hardwood for the variable Gaussian model, and 292
km for Hemlock to 476 km for Elm and Other hardwood for the variable power law
model.
<!--l. 990--><p class="indent" >   To visualize the dispersal patterns predicted by our model, we can estimate the proportion of
deposited pollen by taxon for each grid cell in the domain (previously we were estimating deposited
pollen only at lakes for which we had pollen data) (Figures&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-12">??</span> &amp; <a 
href="#x1-1801310">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:maps_pollen_pl --></a>). These spatial
maps help us understand how the models treat dispersal. Comparing these two figures
illustrates the differences between these two models - the predicted sediment pollen
maps for the variable power law model are much smoother. This is due to the increased
accumulation of dispersed pollen at short distances relative to the Gaussian, which predicts that
the fastest accumulation rate of dispersed pollen occurs farther from the source (see
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-180118">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cdf --></a>).
<!--l. 1005--><p class="indent" >   We can also compare the predicted pollen maps with those depicting the relative tree
abundance (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1801411">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:maps_veg --></a>), remembering that the pollen predictions have been scaled to account for
differential production (so we are comparing predicted sediment pollen with vegetation
                                                                                         <img

composition). This scaling for differential production is particularly apparent for Tamarack.
We know from the data that Tamarack pollen proportions are always lower than the
vegetation proportions, and as a result, we expect that the model will predict low amounts of
Tamarack pollen, which it does. To see how the model predicts dispersal by taxon,
based on parameters estimated from that data, we can compare the vegetation and
pollen ranges. The effects of dispersal are especially clear in the Pine and Oak cases,
where we see pollen dispersing well beyond the range limits of the vegetation range
boundaries.
