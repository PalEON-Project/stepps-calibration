stepps-calibration
==================

This repository contains the STEPPS pollen-veg calibration model code and paper.

To run the code:
1.  Install Stan and RStan.
2.  Edit the pointer to Stan in the Makefile.
3.  Run make. To compile `calibration.stan`, type: `make calibration.exe` in the terminal.
4.  Run the code. I'll make a script to do this so it's easy (now that our data set is fixed).
